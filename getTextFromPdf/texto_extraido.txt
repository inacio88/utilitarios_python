PrefaceWho is this user guide for?
Anyone who wants to quickly acquire knowledge on LibreOffice and is new to office software, or 
may be familiar with another office suite, will find this Getting Started Guide very useful.
LibreOffice is an open-source office productivity software suite containing capabilities for word 
processing, spreadsheets, presentations, graphics, databases, and formula editing.
What is in this user guide?
This user guide introduces the main modules of LibreOffice. 
• Writer (word processing)
• Calc (spreadsheets)
• Impress (presentations)
• Draw (vector graphics)
• Base (database)
• Math (equation editor)
It also covers some of the features common to all modules, including setup and customization, 
styles and templates, macro recording, and printing. For more detail, see the user guides for the 
individual modules.
What is LibreOffice?
LibreOffice is a freely available, fully-featured, open source office productivity suite that is 
compatible with other major office suites and is available on a variety of platforms. The native file  
format used is Open Document Format (ODF). However, LibreOffice can also open and save 
documents in many other formats, including those used by several versions of Microsoft Office. 
For more information, see Appendix B, Open Source, Open Standards, OpenDocument.
Writer (word processor)
Writer is a feature-rich tool for creating letters, books, reports, newsletters, brochures, and other 
documents. Graphics and objects from other LibreOffice modules can be inserted into Writer 
documents. Writer can export files to HTML, XHTML, XML, Portable Document Format (PDF), 
and EPUB. Also, Writer can save files in many other formats, including several versions of 
Microsoft Word files and connect to the email application being used.
Calc (spreadsheet)
Calc has all of the advanced analysis, charting, and decision making features expected from a 
high-end spreadsheet. It includes over 500 functions for financial, statistical, and mathematical 
operations, among others. The Scenario Manager provides “what if” analysis. Calc generates 2D  
and 3D charts, which can be integrated into other LibreOffice documents. Also, Microsoft Excel 
workbooks can be opened and worked on, then saved in Excel format. Calc can also export 
spreadsheets in several formats, including, for example, Comma Separated Value (CSV), Adobe  
PDF and HTML formats.
Impress (presentations)
Impress provides all the common multimedia presentation tools, such as special effects, 
animation, and drawing tools. It is integrated with the advanced graphics capabilities of 
10 |Getting Started 24.8LibreOffice Draw and Math modules. Slideshows can be further enhanced using Fontwork 
special effects text, as well as sound and video clips. Impress can open, edit, and save Microsoft  
PowerPoint presentations and save presentations in numerous graphics formats.
Draw (vector graphics)
Draw is a vector drawing tool that can produce everything from simple diagrams, flowcharts, or 
3D artwork. Its Smart Connectors feature allows definition connection points. Draw creates 
drawings for use in any of the LibreOffice modules, and clip art can be created and added to the 
Gallery. Draw can import graphics from many common formats and save them in many formats, 
including PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, SVG, HTML, PDF and WebP.
Base (database)
Base provides tools for day-to-day database work within a simple interface. Base can create and  
edit forms, reports, queries, tables, views, and relations, so that managing a relational database 
is much the same as in other popular database applications. Base provides many new features, 
such as the ability to analyze and edit relationships from a diagram view. Base incorporates two 
relational database engines, HSQLDB and Firebird. It can also use PostgreSQL, dBASE, 
Microsoft Access, MySQL, Oracle, or any ODBC compliant or JDBC compliant database. Base 
also provides support for a subset of ANSI-92 SQL.
Math (formula editor)
Math is a formula, or equation editor. Math can create complex equations that include symbols 
or characters not available in standard font sets. While Math is most commonly used to create 
formulas in other documents, such as Writer and Impress files, Math can also work as a 
standalone tool. Formulas can be saved in the standard Mathematical Markup Language 
(MathML) format for inclusion in web pages and other documents not created with LibreOffice.
Advantages of LibreOffice
The following explains some of the advantages of LibreOffice has over other office suites:
No licensing fees
LibreOffice is free for anyone to use and distribute at no cost. Many features that are 
available as extra cost add-ins in other office suites (like PDF export) are free with 
LibreOffice. There are no hidden charges now or in the future.
Open source
Distribute, copy, and modify the software as required, in accordance with the LibreOffice 
Open Source licenses.
Cross-platform
LibreOffice runs on several hardware architectures and under multiple operating 
systems, such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Extensive language support
The LibreOffice user interface, including spelling, hyphenation, and thesaurus 
dictionaries, is available in over 100 languages and dialects. LibreOffice also provides 
support for both Complex Text Layout (CTL) and Right to Left (RTL) layout languages 
(such as Urdu, Hebrew, and Arabic).
Consistent user interface
All the modules have a similar “look and feel”, making them easy to use and master.
Preface | 11Integration
The individual modules of LibreOffice are well integrated with the other LibreOffice 
modules.
All modules share a common spelling checker and other tools, which are used 
consistently across the suite. For example, the drawing tools available in Writer are also 
found in Calc with similar, but enhanced versions in Impress and Draw.
There is no need to know which application was used to create a particular file. For 
example, open a Draw file from Writer and this will open Draw automatically.
Granularity
Usually, if you change an option, it affects all modules. However, LibreOffice options can 
be set at a module level or even at document level.
File compatibility
In addition to its native Open Document Formats, LibreOffice includes support for 
opening and saving files in many common formats including Microsoft Office, HTML, 
XML, WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, and PDF. See Appendix B for a list.
No vendor lock-in
LibreOffice uses OpenDocument, an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) file format 
developed as an industry standard by OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of 
Structured Information Standards). These files can easily be unzipped and read by any 
text editor, and their framework is open and published.
All LibreOffice users have a voice
Enhancements, software fixes, and release dates are community-driven. Join the 
community and affect the course of LibreOffice.
Read more about LibreOffice and The Document Foundation on their websites at 
https://www.libreoffice.org/  and https://www.documentfoundation.org/ .
Minimum requirements for using LibreOffice
LibreOffice  requires one of the following operating systems:
• Linux x64 (deb) and Linux x64 (rpm). Snap, Flatpak, Appimage and other packages are 
available as well from your distribution channel.
• Mac OS X (Aarch64/Apple Silicon)
• macOS x86_64 (10.14 (Mojave or higher)
• Windows x86_64 (Windows 8 or newer required)
For a detailed list of requirements and operating systems supported, see the LibreOffice website,  
https://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/system-requirements/ .
Java software
Some LibreOffice features (wizards and the HSQLDB database engine) require that the Java 
Runtime Environment (JRE) or, for macOS, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on a 
computer. If Java is not going to be used, nearly all of the LibreOffice features can still be used.
Java is available at no cost. More information and download links to the appropriate edition for 
your operating system can be found at: https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp .
12 |Getting Started 24.8For macOS, the Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) has to be installed, not just the Java 
Runtime Environment (JRE). Download links can be found at: 
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/ .
If LibreOffice features that require Java are to be used, it is important that the correct 32-bit or 
64-bit edition matches the installed version of LibreOffice. See the Advanced Options in Chapter 
12, Configuring LibreOffice.
How to get LibreOffice
Versions of LibreOffice for Windows, Linux, and macOS are freely available and can be 
downloaded from https://www.libreoffice.org/download . Linux users will also find LibreOffice 
included free in many of the latest distributions.
Other versions of LibreOffice are listed on the download page such as Portable, an app in the 
Microsoft Store and Apple Mac App Store at low and affordable prices. The profits from the sales  
of LibreOffice are invested in supporting the development of the LibreOffice project.
Installing LibreOffice
Information on installing LibreOffice on the various supported operating systems can be found at 
this web page: https://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/install-howto/ . When LibreOffice is acquired 
through official app stores, follow the installation instructions provided by the store.
Setting up and customizing LibreOffice
After installation, to change the default settings (options) in LibreOffice to suit working 
requirements and preferences, go to Tools > Options on the Menu bar (LibreOffice > 
Preferences in macOS). For more information, see Chapter 12, Configuring LibreOffice.
Tip
Some settings are intended for power users and programmers. If it is difficult to 
understand what an option does, LibreOffice recommends leaving the option on its 
default setting unless instructions in this user guide recommend changing the 
setting.
Extensions
More functionalities can be added to LibreOffice by means of extensions. Several extensions 
have been integrated into the software, along with additional extensions obtained from the 
official extensions repository, https://extensions.libreoffice.org/  or from other sources. See 
Chapter 13, Customizing LibreOffice, for more information on installing extensions.

What you see may be different
Illustrations
LibreOffice runs on the Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems, each of which has 
several versions and can be customized by users (fonts, colors, themes, window managers). 
The illustrations in this guide were taken from a variety of computers and operating systems. 
Therefore, some illustrations will not look exactly like what is seen on a computer display.
Also, some of the dialogs may differ because of the settings selected in LibreOffice. Either use 
dialogs from the computer system (default), or dialogs provided by LibreOffice.
To change to using LibreOffice dialogs:
1) On Linux and Windows operating systems, go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > 
General on the Menu bar to open the dialog for general options.
2) On a Mac operating system, go to LibreOffice > Preferences > LibreOffice > General  
on the Menu bar to open the dialog for general options.
3) Select Use LibreOffice dialogs in Open/Save dialogs  to display the LibreOffice dialogs 
on a computer display, as shown in Figure  1.
4) Click OK to save the settings and close the dialog.
16 |Getting Started 24.8Icons
The LibreOffice community has created icons for several icon sets, including Breeze, Colibre, 
Elementary, and Sifr. Each user can also select a preferred set of fonts to use. The icons used to  
illustrate some of the many tools available in LibreOffice may differ from the ones used in this 
guide. The icons in this user guide have been taken from a LibreOffice installation that has been 
set to display the Colibre set of icons.
Figure 2: Options LibreOffice View dialog
Change the icon set used in a LibreOffice installation as follows:
1) On the Linux and Windows operating systems, go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > 
View on the Menu bar to open the dialog for view options.
2) On a Mac operating system, go to LibreOffice > Preferences > LibreOffice > View  on 
the Menu bar to open the dialog for view options.
3) In Icon Style, select a font from the options available in the drop-down list as shown in 
Figure 2.
4) In Icon Size, select the required size from the drop-down lists for Toolbar, Notebookbar 
and Sidebar, as shown in Figure  2.
5) Click OK to save the settings and close the dialog.
Notes
Some Linux operating systems, for example Ubuntu, include LibreOffice as part of 
the installation and may not include the required icon set. This icon set can be 
downloaded from the software repository for the Linux operating system being used.
Some of the previously included icon sets are now available only as extensions; see 
https://extensions.libreoffice.org/?Tags%5B%5D=49  or search for specific ones. For 
example, the People Gallery is available from 
https://extensions.libreoffice.org/en/extensions/show/people-gallery  
Using LibreOffice on macOS
LibreOffice  requires macOS 10.15 or newer to run.
Preface | 17Some keystrokes and menu items are different on macOS from those used in Windows and 
Linux. Table 2 below gives some common substitutions for the instructions in this user guide. For  
a more detailed list, see the application help.

What are all these things called?
The terms used in LibreOffice for most parts of the user interface (the parts of the program seen 
and used, in contrast to the behind-the-scenes code that actually makes it work) are the same 
as for most other programs.
A dialog is a special type of window. Its purpose is to inform, or request input, or both. The 
technical names for common controls are shown in Figure  3. In most cases, these technical 
terms are not used in this user guide, but are useful to know because the Help and other 
sources of information often use these terms.
Figure 3: Dialog showing an example of common controls
(1) Tabbed page (not strictly speaking a control).
(2) Radio buttons (only one can be selected at a time)
(3) Checkbox (more than one can be selected at a time)
(4) Spin box (click the up and down arrows to change the number shown in the 
adjacent text box, or type in the text box).
(5) Thumbnail or preview.
(6) Drop-down list from which to select an item.
(7) Push buttons.
18 |Getting Started 24.8In most cases, you can interact only with the dialog (not the document itself) as long as the 
dialog remains open. When you close the dialog after use (usually, clicking OK or another button  
saves your changes and closes the dialog), then you can again work with the document.
Some dialogs can be left open as you work, so you can switch back and forth between the 
dialog and the document. An example of this type is the Find & Replace dialog.

Frequently asked questions
How is LibreOffice licensed?
LibreOffice is distributed under the Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved Mozilla Public 
License (MPL). See https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/licenses/ .
It is based on code from Apache OpenOffice made available under the Apache License 
2.0 but also includes software that differs from version to version under a variety of other 
Open Source licenses. New code is available under LGPL 3.0 and MPL 2.0.
Can LibreOffice be distributed to anyone?
Yes.
Can LibreOffice be sold?
Yes.
Can LibreOffice be used in a business?
Yes.
How many computers can LibreOffice be installed on?
As many as you like.
Is LibreOffice available in different languages?
LibreOffice has been translated (localized for more than 80%, both UI and Help) into over  
46 languages, so the language required is probably supported. Localization is well under 
way for another 30+ languages (50-80%) and for another 50+ languages help is more 
than welcome. In addition, over 70 spelling, hyphenation, and thesaurus dictionaries are 
available for languages and dialects that do not have a localized program interface. The 
dictionaries are available from the LibreOffice extensions website at: 
https://extensions.libreoffice.org/ .
Are there templates for presentations, spreadsheets, text documents and drawings?
In addition to the bundled templates that comes with your installation, many templates 
are available for download in the LibreOffice templates website at 
https://templates.libreoffice.org/ .
How can LibreOffice be freely available?
LibreOffice is developed and maintained by volunteers and has the backing of several 
organizations. LibreOffice also relies upon donations from its users. To make a donation, 
go to the following web page: https://www.libreoffice.org/donate/ .
Can the programming code from LibreOffice be used when developing a software 
application?
Yes, but follow the parameters set in the MPL and/or LGPL. Read the licenses: 
https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/ .
Preface | 19Why is Java required to run LibreOffice? Is it written in Java?
LibreOffice is not written in Java; it is written in the C++ language. Java is one of several 
languages that can be used to extend the software. The Java JDK/JRE is only required 
for some features. The most notable one is the HSQLDB relational database engine.
Java is available at no cost. More information and download links to the appropriate 
edition for an operating system can be found at: 
https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
Note
If the LibreOffice features that require Java are to be used, it is important that the 
correct 32-bit or 64-bit edition matches the installed version of LibreOffice. If Java is 
not to be used, nearly all of the LibreOffice features can still be used.
How can users contribute to LibreOffice?
Users can help with the development and user support of LibreOffice in many ways, and 
there is no need to be a programmer. To start, check out this web page:

Chapter 1,  LibreOffice Basics  | 23Main LibreOffice window
Each LibreOffice module’s user interface is based on the main LibreOffice window. Each module  
has various details depending on the module’s functions. 
Every module has the Title bar, Menu bar, and Standard toolbar at the top of the window and the  
Status bar at the bottom of the window, while the tools and information vary between each 
LibreOffice module.
Note
By default, LibreOffice commands are grouped in the Standard Toolbar user 
interface. Other user interface variants are available. Go to View > User Interface  
on the Menu bar to change the user interface. For more information, see Chapter 13,  
Customizing LibreOffice.
Title bar
The Title bar is located at the top of the LibreOffice window and it shows the file name of the 
current document. When a document is created the document name will be Untitled X, where X 
is a number. New documents are numbered in the order in which they are created.
Menu bar
The Menu bar is located above the Standard toolbar in Windows and Linux operating systems 
and at the top of the desktop in macOS. When selecting one of the menus in the Menu bar, a 
specific submenu will appear. They feature commands that can do one of these commands:
• Directly cause an action, for example File > Close or Save.
• Open a dialog. Any command that opens a dialog has three dots following that 
command, for example: the command Edit > Find and Replace…  on the Menu bar will 
open a dialog.
• Open another submenu. Any command that opens yet another submenu has a right-
pointing chevron ˃ that follows the command’s name. Moving the mouse’s arrow over 
one of these commands opens another submenu that contains additional commands, for 
example View > Rulers > Rulers , or Vertical Ruler.
• Contains keyboard shortcuts for some commands.
• May contain the icon for the command.
• May contain a selection box or radio button box indicating a selection.
For example, the default Menu bar for the LibreOffice Writer module includes the controls 
described in Table 4.
Table 4: Menu bar entries

 HelpLinks to the LibreOffice Help, What’s This?, and information about LibreOffice.
Note
Table 4 shows the default Menu bar controls for the Writer module. The default 
controls for other modules may vary.
Toolbars
LibreOffice’s toolbars can be in one of two states: docked and floating. A docked toolbar is 
attached to the document’s main window, while floating toolbars are independent of the main 
window and can be moved anywhere on your screen.
In the default LibreOffice installation, the Standard toolbar is docked at the top of the window 
across all of the LibreOffice modules and the second toolbar is in a docked to the top of the 
window. The second toolbar changes depending on which LibreOffice module is open. For 
example, if Writer or Calc are opened, the second docked toolbar is the Formatting toolbar.
Usually, the module’s second toolbar is context-sensitive and usually its set of tools change 
depending on which object is selected. So when a graphic object is selected in Writer, the 
Drawing Object Properties toolbar, which provides tools for formatting graphics, replaces the 
Formatting toolbar. When you deselect the graphic object, the Drawing Object Properties toolbar  
closes and the Formatting toolbar reopens.
Note
When it is necessary to reduce the number of toolbars displayed and provide more 
space for a document, the user interface can be changed to a single-toolbar as an 
alternative to the default double-toolbar user interface. 
This single-toolbar user interface contains the most-used commands. To activate a 
single toolbar user interface, go to View > User Interface  and select Single Toolbar 
from the Select Your Preferred User Interface dialog. For more information, see 
Chapter 13, Customizing LibreOffice.
Displaying or closing toolbars
To display a toolbar, go to View > Toolbars on the Menu bar, and select the name of a toolbar 
from the submenu. All active toolbars have a check-mark next to their name.
To close a toolbar, you can either:
• Go to View > Toolbars on the Menu bar and deselect the toolbar, or
• Right-click in an empty space between the icons on a toolbar and select Close Toolbar 
from the context menu.
Chapter 1,  LibreOffice Basics  | 25Note
The View menu does not include floating toolbars that were created from tool 
palettes, but they are displayed in the LibreOffice window.
Submenus and tool palettes
If a toolbar item has submenus, there will be a small triangle ▼ to the right of the tool’s icon. 
Clicking on the triangle will display submenus containing further commands, tool palettes, or 
alternative methods of selecting items.
A tool palette is a pop-up collection of tools attached to a single tool on a toolbar. Tool palettes 
can be made into floating sub-toolbars using the following example:
Figure 5: Example of creating floating sub-toolbar from a tool palette
1) Click on Basic Shapes on the Drawing toolbar to open the tool palette.
2) Click on the toolbar handle (highlighted in Figure  5) and drag the tool palette onto the 
open document.
3) Release the toolbar handle and the tool palette becomes a floating toolbar.
Note
If the toolbar handle is not visible, the tool palette, or toolbar, is locked into its docked  
position and has to be unlocked. See “ Locking and unlocking toolbars ” below for 
more information.
Locking and unlocking toolbars
If you want to lock all toolbars into place, which will prevent all toolbars from being moved, select  
View > Toolbars on the Menu bar and select Lock Toolbars on the submenu. LibreOffice has 
to be restarted to lock all toolbars. If the command Lock Toolbars has a check mark next to it, 
all toolbars will be locked.
To unlock all toolbars and allow all toolbars to be repositioned, or turned into floating toolbars, go  
to View > Toolbars on the Menu bar and select Lock Toolbars on the submenu. To finish 
unlocking all toolbars, LibreOffice has to be restarted to complete this task. Once you have 
finished unlocking the toolbars, the check mark will removed from the command Lock Toolbars.
However, if you single toolbar to prevent it from being repositioned, or turned into a floating 
toolbar, right-click in an empty space on the toolbar and select Lock Toolbar Position  from the 
submenu that opens. A check mark appears against Lock Toolbar Position .
To unlock a single toolbar so that it can be repositioned, or used as a floating toolbar, right -click 
in an empty space on the toolbar and select Lock Toolbar Position  from the submenu that 
opens. The check mark next to Lock Toolbar Position  is removed.
26 |Getting Started 24.8Moving, docking and floating toolbars
If a toolbars is docked and not locked, it will have a toolbar handle at the left end of the toolbar. 
This dotted toolbar handle is highlighted in Figure  6. This handle is used to control the location of  
the toolbar.
Figure 6: Example of toolbar handles
1) Move the cursor over the toolbar handle (the small vertical bar of dots to the left of a 
docked toolbar). The cursor will change shape to the moving shape used by the 
computer system.
2) Click on the toolbar handle and drag the toolbar to a new docked position, or create a 
floating toolbar, then release the toolbar. When the toolbar becomes a floating toolbar, 
the toolbar handle disappears.
To move a floating toolbar, use one of the following methods:
• Click in the toolbar title bar and drag the toolbar to a new floating position in the main 
window, then drop the toolbar.
• Select the toolbar title bar and drag the toolbar into a location in which it can be docked. 
You can dock a toolbar at the top, the left side, and the bottom of the main window.
• Select the downward triangle ▼ on the toolbar title bar, then select Dock Toolbar from 
the available options. The toolbar is docked in its default position. For example, the 
docked position for the Bullets and Numbering toolbar is at the bottom of the main 
window.
Note
When you are moving a toolbar into a docked location, LibreOffice will indicate that 
the toolbar is in a docked position when you see a hashed border around the toolbar.  
Once the hashed border appears, release the toolbar and the toolbar is docked.
Context sensitive toolbars
Some toolbars in LibreOffice are context sensitive and only open when an object is selected, or 
the cursor has been positioned in text. For example:
• The cursor is positioned in a table and the Table toolbar opens.
• The cursor is positioned in an ordered or unordered list, and the Bullets and Numbering 
toolbar opens.
• An image is selected and the Image toolbar opens.
Customizing toolbars
To customize a toolbar, you can add tools listed in Visible Buttons, or add new tools to a 
toolbar. Also, you can access the customization options for a toolbar by right-clicking in an empty  
space on a docked toolbar or clicking on the downward triangle ▼ on the title bar of a floating 
toolbar to open a context menu:
• To open the Customize dialog an add more tools to the toolbar, select Customize 
Toolbar. If you need more information on customization, see Chapter 13, Customizing 
LibreOffice.
Chapter 1,  LibreOffice Basics  | 27• To dock the selected floating toolbar in its default position, select Dock Toolbar. The 
toolbar can be moved to a different docked position .
• To dock all floating toolbars in their default positions, select Dock All Toolbars . The 
toolbars can be moved to different docked positions.
• To lock a docked toolbar into its docked position, select Lock Toolbar Position .
• To close the selected toolbar, click on the X on the right of the toolbar title bar or select 
Close Toolbar.
• Finally, you can select Visible Buttons and select the required tool from the options in 
the context menu. Tools already installed on a toolbar are indicated by a check mark next  
to the tool icon. The tools are added to the toolbar in the same order as the tools appear 
in the context menu. That is, the top tool in the Visible Buttons list is positioned at the 
left end of the toolbar. The remaining tools are positioned on the toolbar in a position that  
matches its list position.
Context menus
Context menus, which provide quick access to many menu functions, can be opened by right-
clicking on a paragraph, graphic, or other object. When a context menu is opened, the available 
functions or options depend on the object that has been selected. A context menu is the easiest 
way to use a function or option, especially if its location in the menus or toolbars is not known.
Context menus can also display applicable keyboard shortcuts if one has been created, or tool 
icons if available. To use these options, go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > View  (macOS 
LibreOffice > Preferences LibreOffice > View ) and select the options available in Visibility.
Status bar
The Status bar is located at the bottom of the workspace. It provides information about the 
document and also include convenient ways to change some features quickly. It is similar in 
Writer, Calc, Impress, and Draw, but each LibreOffice module includes some module-specific 
items. To hide the Status bar, go to View on the Menu bar and deselect Status Bar.
The Impress Status bar is shown in Figure  7 and it has the following components:
Slide number
The slide number currently displayed in the Impress Workspace and the total number of 
slides in the presentation.

– When no object is selected, Impress displays the current position (X and Y 
coordinates) of the cursor.
– When an object is selected and being resized, this area of the Impress Status bar 
shows the size of the object (width and height).
– If an object is currently selected in Impress, the position numbers shows X and Y 
coordinates of the upper -left corner and the object size number pair displays the size 
of the object. These numbers do not relate to the object itself, but to the selection 
outline, which is the smallest possible rectangle that can contain the visible parts of the  
object.
– When an object is selected, clicking in these areas opens the Position and Size dialog.

When this slider is moved, the slide displayed in the Impress Workspace will adjusts how  
the document is viewed (by percentage) in the Workspace.
Chapter 1,  LibreOffice Basics  | 29Zoom percentage
Indicates the zoom level of the slide displayed in the Impress Workspace. Clicking on 
zoom percentage opens the Zoom & View Layout dialog where the settings for zoom 
factor and view layout are adjusted.
Sidebar
By default, the Sidebar is on the right side of a LibreOffice module’s Workspace. An example of 
the Writer Sidebar is shown in Figure  8. Go to View > Sidebar on the Menu bar to display or 
hide the Sidebar.
The Sidebar contains several decks and each deck contains tools and options for formatting a 
document. The number and type of decks used in the Sidebar depend on the type of document 
and the current LibreOffice module. Decks are organized into panels and an icon bar on the right  
side of the Sidebar allows switching between the different decks.
Figure 8: Example of Properties deck in Writer Sidebar
For all LibreOffice modules, each Sidebar contains Properties, Styles, Gallery, and Navigator 
decks. Some LibreOffice modules also have additional decks:
• Page Style, Design themes, Style Inspector , Manage Track Changes, Accessibility 
check and, Search Text for Writer
• Master Slides, Animation, Shapes, and Slide Transition for ImpressShapes for Draw
• Functions for Calc
In LibreOffice, menus, toolbars, and Sidebar panels share many functions across modules. For 
example, text can be made bold or italic with the Format menu, the Formatting toolbar, or the 
Properties deck. Some Sidebar panels also have a More Options button, which opens a dialog 
30 |Getting Started 24.8with additional editing controls. For more detail on options available on the Sidebar, see the 
guides for each LibreOffice module.
To hide the Sidebar, click on Hide/Show button on the left of the Sidebar (highlighted in 
Figure 8). To show the Sidebar, click on the Hide/Show button again.
To undock the Sidebar and make it floating, do the following:
1) Click on Sidebar Settings at the top right, do the Sidebar.
2) Select Undock from the options available, or use the keyboard shortcut 
Ctrl+Shift+F10 (macOS + ⌘Shift+F10).
To dock the Sidebar into its usual position on the main window, do the following:
1) Click on Sidebar Settings at the top right of the Sidebar.
2) Select Dock from the options available, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+F10 
(macOS + ⌘Shift+F10).
Working with documents

displayed in the context menu.
• Go to File > Open Remote  on the menu bar and select the file from the list of files made  
available by the remote server service. You may be asked to insert the right server 
credentials to open the file.
Notes
Note that the previous names or locations of files that have been renamed or 
relocated may still be in the Start Center, and clicking on those types of filenames will  
generate an error. To remove the file from the Start Center, hover the cursor over the 
thumbnail until an X appears in the upper right corner, and then click on the X.
When you are selecting a LibreOffice file from the Start Center, Open dialog, or file 
browser you can limit the files seen by file type. For example, you select Text 
Documents as the file type, only documents that Writer can open are displayed.
If you need to work with files on remote servers, see Chapter 10, Working with File 
Formats, Security, and Exporting.
Also, LibreOffice can open files compatible with the Open Document Format (ODF), 
which includes many formats from Microsoft. For example, LibreOffice can open MS 
Word files (*.doc or *.docx) in Writer, MS Excel files (*.xls or *.xlsx) can be opened in 
Calc; MS PowerPoint files (*.ppt or *.pptx) can be opened in Impress, and so on. See  
Chapter 10, Working with File Formats, Security and Exporting for more information 
about working with different file types.
Saving documents
LibreOffice documents can be saved with one of the following methods: 
• Save — can save all changes made, keeping the current filename and location of the 
file.
– Go to File > Save on the Menu bar.
– Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S (macOS + ⌘S).
– Click on Save on the Standard toolbar.
– Click on the Save icon in the Status bar.
• Save As — can create a new document, change the filename or file format, or save the 
file in a different location on a computer system.
– Go to File > Save As on the Menu bar.
– Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+S (macOS + ⌘Shift+S).
– Click on the downward triangle ▼ next to Save on the Standard toolbar and select 
Save As from the context menu.
• Save a Copy — can save a copy of the current document, for example, in a different 
location on the computer system. The current document remains open for more editing.
– Go to File > Save a Copy  on the Menu bar.
– Click on the downward triangle ▼ next to Save on the Standard toolbar and select 
Save a Copy from the context menu.
32 |Getting Started 24.8• Save All — can save all the files that are open in LibreOffice. Go to File > Save All on 
the Menu bar. This option is only available when more than one LibreOffice document is 
open.
• Save Remote – save the file in a remote server. The remote server settings must exist 
prior to the Save Remote command. If not, you can define the remote server settings 
and protocols in the Remote Files dialog. Some servers requires the correct credentials 
to allow the files to saved.
Saving documents automatically
If you need LibreOffice to save files automatically, you can use the AutoRecovery function. When  
files are saved automatically, LibreOffice will overwrite the last saved state of the file. To set up 
automatic file saving, do the following:
1) Go to Tools > Options > Load/Save > General  (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > 
Load/Save > General ) on the Menu bar.
2) In Save, select the option AutoRecovery information every  and set the time interval in the  
box, for example 10 minutes.
3) Optionally, you can save the whole file instead by checking the Automatically save the 
document too checkbox. The time interval is the same as the AutoRecovery information 
every time interval.
4) Click OK to save the selection and close the dialog.
Reloading documents
If you reload a document in LibreOffice, all the changes made in an editing session after the last 
save are discarded. To reload a document, go to File > Reload on the Menu bar.
Note
If you reload a document, a confirmation dialog will open and warn the user that 
reloading will discards the last unsaved changes. 
Closing documents
Close a LibreOffice document with one of the following methods:
• Go to File > Close on the Menu bar.
• In Windows or Linux — click on the X at the right end of the Menu bar. 
• In macOS — click on the red button at the left end of the title bar. 
If the document to be closed is the only document that is open, the following happens:
• In Windows or Linux — the document closes and the LibreOffice Start Center opens.
• In macOS — the document closes and the Menu bar remains at the top of the screen.
Note
If the document has not been saved since the last change, a confirmation dialog 
opens with a warning message. Select whether to save, or discard, the changes 
before closing.
Chapter 1,  LibreOffice Basics  | 33Using the Navigator
The Navigator is available as a dialog or Sidebar deck, and it lists all objects contained in a 
document in categories. Examples can be seen in examples from Impress and Writer (Figure  9 
and Figure 10). The Navigator can be opened with one of the following methods:
• Navigator dialog: go to View > Navigator on the Menu bar, or use the keyboard shortcut 
F5 for Windows and macOS, or Ctrl+Shift+F5 for Linux.
• Navigator deck on the Sidebar: click on the Navigator icon on the right of the Sidebar, or 
use the keyboard shortcut Alt+Ctrl+4 for Windows and Linux, or + ⌥ ⌘+4 for macOS.
• To close the Navigator, click on the X on the right of the title bar, or use the keyboard 
shortcut. The categories are specific to each LibreOffice module. Click on the right 
chevron > next to each category name to open the list of objects contained in each 
category. Also, the Navigator provides some functions that are specific to each 
LibreOffice module.
Figure 9: Example of Impress Navigator dialog
The Navigator provides an easy method of locating and selecting objects in a document. If 
possible you should give each object an easily identified name so you can easily locate an 
object, instead of using default names such as Sheet1, Table1, or Image2, and so on. Right -click 
on an object in the Navigator dialog, or Sidebar deck and select Rename from the context menu.
34 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 10: Example of Navigator deck in Writer Sidebar
Displaying multiple views of a document
Users can open multiple views of the same document in LibreOffice. Each view can be displayed  
in its own window and LibreOffice can show different pages, use different zoom levels, or use 
other settings. When a user makes a change to the document in one window, it will be reflected 
in the other windows. For example, when using Writer, separate views of a document can be 
used for copying or moving information from one page to another.
To open a new document window, go to Window > New Window  on the Menu bar. In each open  
window, the filename of the document will be displayed in the title bar. Figure  11 shows how 
separate views of one document can be open at the same time. If other LibreOffice documents 
are open at the same time, the LibreOffice windows list also includes these other documents and  
the active window has a check mark by its filename. You can switch between windows by 
clicking on a name in the list or by clicking on the window itself if it is visible on the display.
Figure 11: Example of separate windows list
To close a window, go to Window > Close Window  on the Menu bar, use the keyboard shortcut 
Ctrl+W (macOS ⌘+W).
Chapter 1,  LibreOffice Basics  | 35Undoing and redoing changes
Undoing
To undo the most recent change in a document, use one of these methods:
• Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Z (macOS ⌘+Z).
• Click on Undo in the Standard toolbar.
• Go to Edit > Undo on the Menu bar.
• Click the small triangle ▼ to the right of Undo on the Standard toolbar to open a list of 
changes that can be undone. Multiple consecutive changes can be selected and deleted 
at the same time.
Redoing
After changes have been undone, changes can be redone using one of the following methods:
• Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Y (macOS ⌘+Y).
• Click on Redo in the Standard toolbar.
• Go to Edit > Redo on the Menu bar.
• Click the small triangle ▼ to the right of Redo on the Standard toolbar to open a list of 
undo commands that can be redone. LibreOffice can select multiple consecutive undo 
commands and redo them at the same time.
Repeating undo and redo commands
Repeating undo and redo commands can save several repetitive menu navigation clicks, or 
keyboard shortcuts, especially when a command is taken from a context menu or submenu. To 
repeat the last undo or redo command applied to a document, use one of the following methods:
• Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Y (macOS ⌘+Shift+Y).
• Go to Edit > Repeat on the Menu bar.

LibreOffice printing options
General printing options
After you install a printer on a computer, the general printing options for LibreOffice can be 
customized. Go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > Print  (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences 
> LibreOffice > Print ) to open the Options LibreOffice Print dialog (Figure  15). The general print  
options for LibreOffice are as follows:
Settings for
Specifies whether the print settings apply to direct printing or to printing to a file.
Defaults
Convert colors to grayscale
Specifies that all colors in a document are printed only as greyscale.
Include transparent objects
If selected, the reduction in print quality for bitmaps also applies to the transparent 
areas of objects.
Figure 15: Options LibreOffice Print dialog
Reduce bitmaps
Specifies that bitmaps are printed with reduced quality. The resolution can only be 
reduced and not increased.
Chapter 1,  LibreOffice Basics  | 39Resolution
Specifies the maximum print quality in DPI. The resolution can only be reduced and 
not increased.
High print quality
High print quality corresponds to a resolution of 300dpi.
Normal print quality
Normal print quality corresponds to a resolution of 200dpi.
Note
Reducing the amount of data sent by LibreOffice to the printer increases the print 
speed because the print files are smaller. This makes it easier for printers with a 
smaller memory when printing large files. However, reducing print data can result in 
slightly lower print quality.
Reduce transparency
If selected, transparent objects are printed like normal, non-transparent objects, 
depending on your selection in the following two option buttons.
Automatically
Specifies that the transparency is only printed if the transparent area covers less than 
a quarter of the entire page.
No transparency
When selected, a transparency does not print.
Note
Transparencies cannot be sent directly to a printer. Transparencies must be visible to  
be calculated by LibreOffice as bitmaps and sent to the printer. Depending on bitmap  
size and the print resolution, a large amount of data may be generated.
Warnings
Defines which warnings appear before printing begins.
Paper size
Select this option if a certain paper size is required for printing the current document. If  
the paper size used in the document is not provided by the current printer, an error 
message opens.
Paper orientation
Select this option if a certain paper orientation is required for printing the current 
document. If the format used by the current document is not available from the printer, 
an error message opens.
Transparency
Select this option if a warning is required if transparent objects are contained in the 
document. When printing a document with transparencies, a dialogue box opens to 
enable selection if the transparency is to be printed.
Reduce gradient
If selected, gradients are printed with reduced quality.
Gradient stripes
Specifies the maximum number of gradient stripes for printing.
Intermediate color
Specifies that gradients are only printed in a single intermediate color.

Using Safe Mode
Safe Mode is used to restore LibreOffice after it has stopped working, fails to launch correctly, or 
a file has become corrupted. It starts LibreOffice with a fresh user profile and disables hardware 
acceleration.
Go to Help > Restart in Safe Mode  on the Menu bar to open the Safe Mode dialog (Figure  19).
Note
It is recommended to use Safe Mode options from the top down (Figure 19) because 
the options get more extreme from the top down.
Restore from backup
If you suspect that the problems were caused by recent changes to LibreOffice’s working  
state, this option may help you. Since LibreOffice keeps backups of previous 
configurations and activated extensions, Restore from backup will allow you to restore 
the user configuration, installed extensions (or both), to a previous known working state. 
Chapter 1,  LibreOffice Basics  | 47Configure
This Safe Mode option disables either all user extensions, hardware acceleration, or both  
functions. This may help you if there are crashes on startup or visual glitches that are 
often related to hardware acceleration.
Extensions
If you think that a corrupted extension is blocking or causing LibreOffice to crash, this 
option will uninstall all user extensions and reset the state of any shared or bundled 
extensions. In the case of shared, or bundled extensions, the option only works if a user 
has the proper system access rights. It should be used with caution.
Reset to factory settings
If all of the above fails, this function will reset the settings and user interface 
modifications (or the entire user profile) back to factory defaults.
Reset settings and user interface modifications
This function resets any user interface and configuration changes, but keeps items such 
as personal dictionary, templates, and so on.
Reset entire user profile
This function erases all customized options and returns a user profile to the factory 
default state.
Continue in Safe Mode
If you need to continue in Safe Mode, it allows you to work in LibreOffice with a 
temporary profile that was created on startup. Any extensions or configuration options set  
up previously have to be reconfigured before using. Keep in mind that any changes 
made to the temporary user profile are lost after a restart.
Figure 19: Safe Mode dialog
48 |Getting Started 24.8Restart in Normal Mode
If you have started Safe Mode accidentally, this option discards any changes, terminating  
Safe Mode, and restarting LibreOffice normally.
Apply Changes and Restart
Select this option to apply any of the above changes and restart LibreOffice.
Note
If problems are not solved using Safe Mode, selecting Advanced provides 
instructions on receiving further aid.
Advanced can allow you to create a zip file of a corrupted user profile, and this file 
can be uploaded to the bug tracking system for further investigation by the 
LibreOffice developers. Remember that an uploaded user profile may also contain 
sensitive information such as installed extensions, personal dictionaries, and user-
specific settings.

Sidebar
The Sidebar is normally open by default on the right side of the Writer window. If necessary, 
select View > Sidebar on the Menu bar, or press Ctrl+F5, to display it. An example is shown in 
Chapter 1, LibreOffice Basics.
The Writer Sidebar contains eight decks by default: Properties, Styles, Gallery, Navigator, Page, 
Style Inspector, Manage Changes, Accessibility Check, and Find. Each deck has a 
corresponding icon on the Tab bar on the right of the Sidebar, allowing you to switch between 
them. The decks are described below.
Each deck consists of a title bar and one or more content panels. Some panels contain a small 
More Options button, which opens a dialog to give greater choice of editing controls. When the

four panels:
• Format modifies the size, width, height, orientation, and page margins.
• Styles modifies the numbering scheme, background, page layout (specifies whether the 
page style should apply to odd or even pages or to both), and columns.
• Header and Footer activate/deactivate and modify the respective margins, spacing, and 
content.
56 |Getting Started 24.8Caution
Changing the options on the Page deck modifies the page style in use, affecting not 
only the current page but all pages in the document using the same page style.
Style Inspector deck : Displays all the attributes of paragraph styles, character styles, and 
manual (direct) formatting for selected text. For more information, see the Writer Guide.
Manage Changes deck : Lists tracked changes that have not yet been accepted or rejected. You

Changing document views
Writer has three ways to view a document: Normal, Web, and Full Screen. To change the view, 
go to the View menu and select the desired view.
Normal view
Normal view is the default view in Writer. It shows how the document will look when you 
print it or create a PDF. In this view, you can hide or show the headers and footers and 
the gap between pages by choosing View > Show Whitespace  on the Menu bar. This 
works only when single-page view is activated on the Status Bar. Hiding whitespace also 
works in Full Screen view.
Web view
Web view shows how the document will look if viewed in a Web browser; this is useful 
when you create HTML documents. In Web view, you can use only the Zoom slider; the 
View Layout buttons on the Status Bar are disabled, and most of the choices on the 
Zoom & View Layout dialog are not available. There is no visual indication of page 
boundaries.
Full Screen view
In Full Screen view, no toolbars or sidebar are displayed; the document takes up the full 
area available, using the zoom and layout settings previously selected. To exit Full 
Screen view and return to the previous view, press the Esc key or click the Full Screen 
button on the floating toolbar in the top left-hand corner. You can also use 
Ctrl+Shift+J to toggle between Full Screen and the previous views.
Working with documents
Chapter 1, LibreOffice Basics, includes instructions on creating new documents, opening 
existing documents, and saving documents. Chapter 4, Working with Styles, Templates, and 
Hyperlinks, covers how to create a document from a template.
By default, LibreOffice creates and saves files in the OpenDocument format (ODF). Writer 
documents have the extension .ODT.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 57Tip
Whenever it is possible to choose the document file format, you should choose to 
work with the default ODF format. This reduces the likelihood of errors and 
compatibility issues.
Saving as a Microsoft Word file
You may need to open, edit, and save documents in Microsoft Word formats. You can also 
create and edit .ODT files and then save them as .DOCX or .DOC files. To do this:
1) Important — First save your document in the file format used by LibreOffice Writer 
(.ODT). If you do not, any changes you made since the last time you saved will appear 
only in the Microsoft Word version of the document. Also, saving in ODF format enables 
you to re-save or modify the document if the recipient of the document experiences 
trouble with the Microsoft format.
2) Then choose File > Save As.
3) On the Save As dialog, in the File type drop-down menu, select the Word format you 
need. You may also choose to change the file name.
4) Click Save.
This creates a separate document with a different file extension (such as .DOCX). From this 
point on, all changes you make to the document will occur only in the new document. If you want  
to go back to working with the .ODT version of your document, you must open it again.
Tip
To have Writer save documents by default in a Microsoft Word file format, go to 
Tools > Options > Load/Save > General . In the section named Default File Format 
and ODF Settings, under Document type, select Text document, then under Always 
save as, select your preferred file format.
Exchanging documents with users of Apple Pages
Although Writer can open and edit files in Apple Pages format ( *.pages), it cannot save in that 
format or export to that format. Apple Pages cannot open files in OpenDocument format, so if 
you need to share files with users of Pages, save your .odt file in a compatible format, such as  
.rtf or .docx. If you attempt to save an edited .pages file, the Save As dialog opens.
Pages users can also export (not save) a copy of a Pages document in a format compatible with 
Writer, such as .docx or .rtf, which Writer can then open, edit, and save to.
Note
More information about different file formats can be found in Chapter 10, Working 
with File Formats, Security and Exporting.
58 |Getting Started 24.8Moving quickly through a document
Using the Navigator
The Navigator provides several convenient ways to move around a document and find items in 
it. It lists the headings, tables, text frames, graphics, bookmarks, and other objects in the 
document.
• When a category is showing the list of objects in it, double-click on an object to jump 
directly to that object’s location in the document.
• In the top left of the Navigator is a Navigate By drop-down list. You can pick a type of 
object (such as a bookmark, table, or index entry) and then use the Previous (^) and 
Next (v) buttons to jump from one to the next (Figure 24).
• On the top right of the Navigator is a Go to Page field, which you can use to jump 
directly to a specific page.
For more uses of the Navigator in Writer, see the Writer Guide.
Figure 24: Navigate By list on Navigator
Using the Go to Page dialog
To jump to a specific page in the document:
• Use the Go to Page field on the top right of the Navigator (see above).
• Use the Go to Page dialog (Figure 25), which shows the current page number and the 
number of pages in the document. Type the number of the destination page in the text 
box and click OK. To open this dialog, do any of the following:
– Click on the page number field in the Status bar.
– Choose Edit > Go to Page  on the Menu bar.
– Press Ctrl+G on the keyboard.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 59Figure 25: Go to Page dialog
Working with text
Selecting, copying, pasting, or moving text in Writer is similar to working with text in other 
programs. LibreOffice also has some convenient ways to select items that are not next to each 
other, select a vertical block of text, and paste unformatted text.
Selecting items that are not consecutive
To select non-consecutive items (as shown in Figure 26) using the mouse:
1) Select the first piece of text.
2) Hold down the Ctrl key and use the mouse to select the next piece of text.
3) Repeat as often as needed.
To select non-consecutive items using the keyboard:
1) Select the first piece of text.
2) Press Shift+F8. This puts Writer in “Adding selection” mode.
3) Use the arrow keys to move to the start of the next piece of text to be selected. Hold 
down the Shift key and select the next piece of text.
4) Repeat as often as required.
Now you can work with the selected text (copy it, delete it, change the style, and so on). 
Press Esc to exit from this mode.
Figure 26: Selecting items that are not next to each other
For more information about keyboard selection of text, see the topic “Navigating and selecting 
with the keyboard” in LibreOffice Help ( F1).
60 |Getting Started 24.8Selecting a vertical block of text
You can select a vertical block or “column” of text that is separated by spaces or tabs (as you 
might see in text pasted from e-mails, program listings, or other sources), using Block selection 
mode. To change to Block selection mode, use Edit > Selection Mode > Block Area , or press 
Alt+Shift+F8, or right-click on the Selection icon on the Status bar and select Block 
selection in the pop-up menu.
Figure 27: Selection icon
Now highlight the selection, using mouse or keyboard, as shown below.
Figure 28: Selecting a vertical block of text
Cutting, copying, and moving text
Cutting and copying text in Writer is similar to cutting and copying text in other applications. You 
can use the mouse or the keyboard. You can copy or move text within a document, or between 
documents, by dragging or by using menu selections, toolbar buttons, or keyboard shortcuts. 
You can also copy text from other sources such as Web pages and paste it into a Writer 
document.
To move (drag and drop) selected text using the mouse, drag it to the new location and release 
it. To copy selected text, hold down the Ctrl key while dragging. The text retains the formatting 
it had before dragging.
To move (cut and paste) selected text, use Ctrl+X to cut the text, insert the cursor at the paste-
in point and use Ctrl+V to paste. Alternatively, use the Copy / Paste buttons on the Standard 
toolbar, or the options under Edit on the Menu bar.
To move an entire paragraph up or down in the document, click on the paragraph and press 
Ctrl+Alt+Up or Ctrl+Alt+Down respectively.
Pasting text
When you paste text, the result depends on the source of the text and how you paste it. If you 
click on the Paste button on the Standard toolbar or use Ctrl+V, any formatting the text has 
(such as bold or italics) is retained. Text pasted from websites and other sources may also be 
placed into frames or tables. If you do not like the results, click the Undo button or press 
Ctrl+Z.
To make the pasted text inherit the paragraph style at the insertion point, do any of the following:
• Choose Edit > Paste Special .
• Click the arrow on the Paste button on the Standard toolbar.
• Double-click the Paste button without releasing the left mouse button.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 61• Press Ctrl+Shift+V.
Then select Paste Unformatted Text  or Unformatted text in the resulting menu. Unformatted 
text can also be pasted directly by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+V  on the keyboard.
Finding and replacing text and formatting
Writer has three ways to find text within a document: the Find toolbar and the Find deck in the 
Sidebar for fast searching, and the Find and Replace dialog. In the dialog, you can:
• Find and replace words and phrases
• Use wildcards and regular expressions to fine-tune a search
• Find and replace specific attributes or formatting
• Find and replace paragraph styles
Using the Find toolbar
By default, the Find toolbar is docked at the bottom of the LibreOffice window (just above the 
Status bar) as shown in Figure 29, but you can float it or dock it in another location. If the Find 
toolbar is not visible, you can display it by choosing View > Toolbars > Find  on the Menu bar, 
selecting Edit > Find on the Menu bar, or by pressing Ctrl+F. For more information on floating 
and docking toolbars, see Chapter 1, LibreOffice Basics.
Figure 29: Docked position of Find toolbar
To use the Find toolbar, click in the box and type your search text, then press Enter to find the 
next occurrence of that term. Click the Find Next or Find Previous (arrow) buttons as needed.
Click the Find All button to select all instances of the search term within the document. Select 
Match Case to find only the instances that also match the case (capitalization). To open the Find  
and Replace dialog, click the icon to the right of Match Case.
To close the Find toolbar, click the X button on the left, or press Esc on the keyboard when the 
cursor is in the search box.
Using the Find deck in the Sidebar
The Find deck in the Sidebar is another handy toolto locate quickly all occurences of text in the 
document.
1) Open the Find deck in the Sidebar (Figure 30) or use Alt+9.
2) Enter the text in the Find box on the top.
3) Press Enter.
LibreOffice locates all the text occurrences in the Find box and presents the results in the area 
just below with an indication of the page number and text portion of the occurrence. Click on the 
text found to jump to the page and highlight the search text found (Figure 30).
Note
The search is case insensitive.
62 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 30: Find deck in Sidebar
Using the Find and Replace dialog
To display the Find and Replace dialog (Figure 31), use any of the following methods:
• Press Ctrl+H on the keyboard.
• Choose Edit > Find and Replace  on the Menu bar.
• Click the Find and Replace  icon on the Find toolbar. 
Figure 31: Expanded Find and Replace dialog
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 63When the Find and Replace dialog is open, optionally click Other options to expand it.
1) Type the text you want to find in the Find box.
2) To replace the text with different text, type the new text in the Replace box.
3) You can select various options such as matching the case or matching whole words only.  
4) The other options include searching only in selected text, searching from the current 
cursor position backwards toward the beginning of the file, searching for similar words, 
searching in comments, and using regular expressions (wildcards). The exact options 
may vary with your language settings ( Tools > Options > Languages and Locales  > 
General).
5) When you have set up the search, click Find Next. To replace the found text, click 
Replace. If you click Find All, LibreOffice selects all instances of the search text in the 
document. Similarly, if you click Replace All, LibreOffice replaces all matches, without 
stopping for you to accept each instance.
Caution
Use Replace All with caution; otherwise, you may end up with mistakes that you 
won’t be able to undo later if you save and close the file. ( Ctrl+Z works only before 
the file is saved.) A mistake with Replace All might require a manual, word-by-word, 
search to fix.
Tip
Regular expressions offer powerful ways to search and replace text. For example, 
they can find all instances where any number is followed by specific letters. However,  
they can be challenging to understand. Refer to the Help files for guidance.
For more information on using Find and Replace, see the Writer Guide.
Inserting special characters
A special character is one not found on a standard user’s keyboard. For example, © ¾ æ ç ñ ö ø  
¢ are all special characters not available on an English keyboard.
To insert one or more special characters, place the cursor where you want the character to 
appear. Then do one of the following:
• Click the Special Character  icon on the Standard toolbar to open a list of favorite and 
recently used characters and click on the one you wish to insert (Figure 32). You can 
also open the Special Characters dialog (Figure 33) by clicking the More Characters 
button.
64 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 32: Insert Special Characters icon in the standard toolbar
• Choose Insert > Special Character  on the Menu bar, to open the Special Characters 
dialog (Figure 33). Double-click the characters (from any font or mixture of fonts) you 
wish to insert, in order, then click Insert.
The Special Characters dialog (Figure 33) includes areas to select Recent Characters  and 
Favorite Characters . To add a new character to the Favorite Characters  list, click on a character 
and click the Add to Favorites button.
Tip
Different fonts have their own distinct special characters. If you do not find a 
particular special character, try changing the Font selection.
Figure 33: The Special Characters dialog
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 65Inserting non-breaking spaces and hyphens
Non-breaking spaces
To prevent two words from being separated at the end of a line, press Ctrl+Shift when 
you type the space between the two words. This inserts a non-breaking space. You can 
also use Insert > Formatting Mark > Insert non-breaking space  on the Menu bar.
Non-breaking hyphens
In cases where you do not want the hyphen to appear at the end of a line, for example in 
a number such as 123 -4567, you can press Ctrl+Shift+minus sign  or use Insert > 
Formatting Mark > Insert non-breaking hyphen .
Inserting en and em dashes
To enter en and em dashes as you type, you can use Replace dashes on the Options tab in the 
AutoCorrect dialog ( Tools > AutoCorrect > AutoCorrect Options) . This option replaces one or 
two hyphens, under certain conditions, with the corresponding dash. See the Help or the Writer 
Guide for more details and other methods of inserting dashes.
–An en-dash is a dash the width of the letter “n” in the font you are using. Type at least 
one character, a space, a hyphen, another space, and at least one more letter. The 
hyphen will be replaced by an en-dash.
—An em-dash is a dash the width of the letter “m” in the font you are using. Type at least 
one character, two hyphens, and at least one more character. The two hyphens will be 
replaced by an em-dash. Exception: if the characters are numbers, as in a date or time 
range, the two hyphens are replaced by an en-dash.
Checking spelling and grammar
By default, four dictionaries are installed for each language, if they are available for that 
language: a spelling checker, a grammar checker, a hyphenation dictionary, and a thesaurus. 
The spelling checker determines if each word in the document is in the installed dictionary. The 
grammar checker works in combination with the spelling checker. You can choose to check 
spelling and grammar automatically as you type, or at any other time, or both.
Checking spelling and grammar automatically
When Automatic Spell Checking  is selected in the Tools menu, Standard toolbar, or Options 
dialog, each word is checked as it is typed and a wavy red line appears under any unrecognized 
words. If Check grammar as you type  has also been enabled, errors are marked with a wavy 
blue underline. See “ Checking grammar ” on page 77.
At any time, you can right-click on an unrecognized word to open a context menu (Figure 34), 
where you can choose one of the suggested words to replace it. When the word is corrected, the  
line disappears. If the word is correct but not in the dictionary, you can chose Add to dictionary . 
If the list does not contain the word you want, click Spelling to open the Spelling dialog 
(Figure 35).
66 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 34: Spelling context menu
Using the Spelling dialog
In addition to automatic checking, or in place of it, you can perform a combined spelling and 
grammar check on the document (or a text selection). Click the Check Spelling button on the 
Standard toolbar, or choose Tools > Spelling, or press F7 on the keyboard. This checks the 
document or selection and opens the Spelling dialog if any unrecognized words are found. To 
also identify potential grammar problems, select the Check grammar checkbox.
Here are some more features of the spelling checker:
Text language
The language to be used for checking spelling can be selected in this drop-down list.
Add a word to the dictionary
Add a word to the dictionary by clicking Add to Dictionary  in the Spelling dialog or in the  
context menu. The word will be added to the Standard dictionary, unless you have 
created another dictionary in the same language. If you have created a new dictionary, 
you will be given a choice of dictionaries to add the word to.
Choose text for spell checking
Choose whether to check uppercase words or words that contain numbers, by clicking 
the Options button on the Spelling dialog to open a dialog similar to the one in Tools > 
Options > Languages and Locales  > Writing Aids, described in Chapter 12, 
Configuring LibreOffice.
Manage custom dictionaries
Create, edit, or delete dictionaries and edit words in the dictionary in the same Options 
dialog.
Specify language for specific paragraphs
Set paragraphs to be checked in a language (different from the rest of the document) 
using several methods—for example, by clicking on the Text Language field on the 
Status Bar or by creating paragraph styles for specific languages. See “ Using built-in 
language tools” on page 93 or refer to the Writer Guide for more information.
See the Writer Guide for more information about the spelling and grammar checking options.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 67Figure 35: Spelling dialog
Checking grammar
If any grammar errors are detected, they are shown underlined by a wavy blue line. Right-click 
on this line to open a context menu.
The first entry in the context menu describes the suspected broken grammatical rule.
Figure 36: Context menu for grammar errors
The second menu item may be Explanations, which opens your browser to a web page offering  
more information about the error. Next may be the suggested correction. Clicking this changes 
the text to the suggestion.
In the third section of the context menu, you can choose to ignore the indicated error, or open 
the Spelling dialog (Figure 35). In the final section of the menu, you can set the language for the 
selection or the paragraph.
You can select additional grammar checking rules through Tools > Options > Languages and 
Locales > English Sentence Checking , or add remote LanguageTool grammar checking 
through Tools > Options > Languages and Locales  > LanguageTool Server . See Chapter 
12, Configuring LibreOffice, for details.
68 |Getting Started 24.8Using synonyms and the thesaurus
To access a short list of synonyms, right-click on a word and point to Synonyms in the context 
menu. A submenu of alternative words and phrases is displayed. Click on a word or phrase in 
the submenu to have it replace the highlighted word or phrase in the document.
The thesaurus gives a more extensive list of alternative words and phrases. To use the 
thesaurus, click on Thesaurus in the Synonyms submenu. If the current language does not 
have a thesaurus installed, this feature is disabled.
Using AutoCorrect
Writer’s AutoCorrect function has a long list of common misspellings and typing errors, which it 
corrects automatically. It also includes codes for inserting special characters, emoji, and other 
symbols.
AutoCorrect is turned on by default. You may wish to disable some of its features, modify others,  
or turn it off completely. To turn AutoCorrect off, uncheck Tools > AutoCorrect > While Typing .
You can add your own corrections or special characters or change those supplied with 
LibreOffice. Choose Tools > AutoCorrect > AutoCorrect Options  to open the AutoCorrect 
dialog. On the Replace tab, you can define which strings of text are corrected and how. In most 
cases, the defaults are fine.
To stop Writer replacing a specific spelling, go to the Replace tab, highlight the word pair, and 
click Delete. To add a new spelling to the list, type it into the Replace and With boxes on the 
Replace tab, and click New.
See the different tabs of the dialog for the other options available to fine-tune AutoCorrect.
Tip
LibreOffice has an extensive list of special characters accessible with AutoCorrect. 
For example, type :smiling: and AutoCorrect will replace it with ☺. Or, (c) will be 
changed to ©. You can add your own special characters.
Using Word Completion
If Word Completion is enabled, Writer tries to guess which word you are typing and offers to 
complete the word for you. To accept the suggestion, press Enter. Otherwise, continue typing.
To turn off Word Completion, select Tools > AutoCorrect > AutoCorrect Options  and deselect 
Enable word completion  on the Word Completion tab.
Options for customizing word completion from the AutoCorrect dialog include:
• Add (append) a space automatically after an accepted word.
• Show the suggested word as a tip (hovering over the word) rather than completing the 
text as you type.
• As you add words when working on documents, you can either save them for later use in  
other documents or select the option to remove them from the list when closing 
documents.
• Change the maximum number of words remembered for word completion and the length  
of the smallest words to be remembered.
• Delete specific entries from the word completion list.
• Change the key that accepts a suggested entry—the options are right arrow, End key, 
Return (Enter), Space bar, and Tab.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 69Note
Automatic word completion only occurs after you type a word for the second time in a  
document.
Using AutoText
Use AutoText to store text, tables, fields, and other items for reuse and assign them to a key 
combination for easy retrieval. For example, rather than typing “Senior Management” every time 
you use that phrase, you can set up an AutoText entry to insert those words when you type “sm” 
and press F3.
To store some text as AutoText:
1) Type the text into your document, then select the text.
2) Choose Tools > AutoText on the Menu bar (or press Ctrl+F3).
3) In the AutoText dialog (Figure 37), type a name for the AutoText in the Name box. Writer 
will suggest a one-letter shortcut, which you can change.
Figure 37: Creating an AutoText entry
4) Choose the category for the AutoText entry, for example My AutoText.
5) Click the AutoText button at the bottom of the dialog and select in the menu either New, 
to have the AutoText retain specific formatting, no matter where it is inserted, or New 
(text only), to have the AutoText take on the existing formatting around the insertion 
point.
6) Click Close to return to your document.
To insert AutoText, type the shortcut and press F3.
Tip
If the only option under the AutoText button is Import, either you have not entered a 
name for your AutoText or there is no text selected in the document.
70 |Getting Started 24.8AutoText is especially powerful when assigned to fields. See the Writer Guide for more 
information.
Changing the case of selected text
To quickly change the case of text, select it, choose Format > Text on the Menu bar, and then 
choose one of the items on the submenu. The most common are:
• UPPERCASE, where all letters are capitalized.
• lowercase, where no words (except proper nouns) are capitalized.
• Sentence case, where only the first word is capitalized (together with any proper 
nouns).
• Capitalize Every Word , where every word is capitalized.
• Small capitals, which capitalizes all letters in a reduced font size.
Writer does not have an automated way to do Title Case, where all words are capitalized except  
for certain subsets defined by rules that are not universally standardized. However, you can use 
Capitalize Every Word  and then restore those words that you do not want capitalized.
Formatting text
You can format text in two ways. See the Writer Guide for details.
Direct (or Manual) formatting
Applies formatting directly to specific paragraphs, characters, pages, frames, lists, or 
tables. For example, you can select a word, then click on a button on the Formatting 
toolbar to format the text as bold or italics.
Styles
Bundles formatting options. For example, a paragraph style defines numerous settings 
for options such as font type and size, whether paragraphs should be indented, the 
space between lines, how paragraphs should be aligned on the page, and many others.
Using styles is highly recommended
Writer is a style-based program. Because styles apply whole groups of formats at the same time,  
you can easily format a document consistently and change the formatting of an entire document 
with minimal effort. In addition, LibreOffice uses styles for many processes, even if you are not 
aware of them. For example, Writer relies on heading styles (or other styles you specify) when it 
compiles a table of contents.
Writer defines six types of styles: paragraph, character, frame, page, list, and table. See Chapter  
4, Working with Styles, Templates and Hyperlinks, in this book and also refer to the Writer Guide.
Formatting paragraphs using styles
Styles can be applied to paragraphs in several ways:
• Styles drop-down selection list at the left end of the Formatting toolbar
• Styles deck of the Sidebar
• Styles menu on the Menu bar (limited to common styles)
• Keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+5 (paragraph styles Heading 1 to Heading 5)
You can also open a Formatting (Styles) toolbar using View > Toolbars > Formatting (Styles) ; 
see Figure 38.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 71Figure 38: Formatting (Styles) toolbar
Formatting paragraphs directly
You can manually apply many direct formats to paragraphs using the buttons on the Formatting 
toolbar and by using the Paragraph panel of the Sidebar’s Properties deck. Not all buttons are 
visible in a standard installation, but you can customize the toolbar to include those you use 
regularly. These buttons and formats include:
• Set Paragraph Style
• Toggle Unordered List (with a palette of bullet styles)
• Toggle Ordered List (with a palette of numbering styles)
• Align Left, Align Center, Align Right, Justified
• Align Top, Center Vertically, Align Bottom
• Line Spacing (choose from 1, 1.15, 1.5, 2, or custom spacing)
• Increase Paragraph Spacing, Decrease Paragraph Spacing
• Increase Indent, Decrease Indent, Hanging Indent
• Paragraph (to open the Paragraph dialog)
• Set Line Spacing
Note
Direct formatting (also called manual formatting) overrides styles. This means that 
when a new style is applied, direct formatting is not removed and still determines the 
displayed format.
Removing direct formatting
To remove direct formatting, select the text and choose Format > Clear Direct Formatting  on 
the Menu bar, or right-click and choose Clear Direct Formatting  in the context menu, or press 
Ctrl+M on the keyboard, or select the Clear Direct Formatting  icon on the Formatting toolbar.
Note
When clearing direct formatting, the text formatting will return to the applied 
paragraph and character style and not the default paragraph style or default 
character style (unless these styles are actually applied to the text).
Formatting characters using styles
To apply a character style, highlight the characters or words and apply the selected character 
style from the Character Styles tab of the Styles deck on the Sidebar, in the Styles menu on the 
Menu bar (limited), or from the right-click context menu (limited).
Formatting characters directly
It is recommended that you use styles to format characters as much as possible rather than 
formatting characters directly, as described in this section.
72 |Getting Started 24.8You can directly apply many formats to characters using the buttons on the Formatting toolbar 
and by using the Character panel of the Sidebar’s Properties deck. Not all buttons are visible in 
a standard installation, but you can customize the toolbar to include those you use regularly. 
These buttons and formats include:
• Font Name, Font Size
• Bold, Italic, Underline, Overline, Strikethrough, Outline Font Effect, Shadow
• Superscript, Subscript
• Uppercase, Lowercase
• Increase Font Size, Decrease Font Size
• Font Color (with a palette of colors)
• Background Color (with a palette of colors)
• Character Highlighting Color (with a palette of colors)
Note
Just as direct paragraph formatting overrides the current paragraph style, applying 
direct character formatting to characters overrides the current character style 
formatting.
Formatting tables
Tables in a Writer document share the same sets of formatting elements as spreadsheets in 
LibreOffice Calc. You can format tables manually or using table styles. Writer has predefined 
table styles and you can also define your own using the AutoFormat Styles dialog.
To apply a table style, click in the table to be formatted and double-click on a style listed in the 
Table Styles tab of the Sidebar’s Styles deck. Alternatively, click in the table to be formatted, 
choose Table > AutoFormat Styles  on the Menu bar and select a style from the dialog that 
opens. For more information, refer to the Writer Guide.
Autoformatting
You can set Writer to format or correct parts of a document automatically as you type, according 
to the choices made on the Options and Localized Options tabs of the AutoCorrect dialog ( Tools 
> AutoCorrect > AutoCorrect Options ).
Autoformatting on the Options tab includes URL recognition, bulleted and numbered lists, 
capitalizing the first letter of every sentence, and correcting two initial capitals on words.
A bulleted (unordered) list is created when you type a hyphen (-), star (*), or plus sign (+), 
followed by a space or tab at the beginning of a paragraph. A numbered (ordered) list is created 
when you type a number followed by a period (.), followed by a space or tab at the beginning of 
a paragraph.
The Localized Options tab controls the formatting of quotation marks and apostrophes (which 
look like a closing single quote). Most fonts include curly quotation marks (also known as “smart 
quotes”), but for some purposes (such as marking minutes and seconds of latitude and 
longitude) you may wish to format them as straight quotes.
Straight quotes Smart quotes
 ' '  " "  ‘ ’  “ ”
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 73Tip
If you notice unexpected formatting changes occurring in your document, this is the 
first place to look for the cause. In most cases Edit > Undo (Ctrl+Z) fixes the issue.
Creating lists with styles
For more about creating lists using styles, see the Writer Guide.
Creating unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists
Whenever possible, use paragraph styles for creating unordered (bulleted) and ordered 
(numbered) lists. Writer comes with two sets of paragraph styles for this purpose.
However, these styles do not include options for settings such as the type of bullet or position of 
numbers. Those settings come from list styles, which are a different type of style. Writer’s 
separate list styles have two major advantages: the same list style can be used with multiple 
paragraph styles, and a paragraph’s associated list style can be changed with a single selection.
It is recommended to use paragraph and list styles together in these ways:
• Use paragraph styles List 1, List 2, List 3, and so on for creating unordered lists. Use any  
of the Bullet list styles with these paragraph styles.
• Use paragraph styles Numbering 1, Numbering 2, Numbering 3, etc, for creating ordered  
lists. Use any of the Numbering list styles with these paragraph styles.
You can use the predefined paragraph and list styles or define your own.
To assign a list style to a paragraph style, go to the Styles deck in the Sidebar, right-click on the 
paragraph style you want to use, then choose Edit Style. On the Outline & List tab on the 
Paragraph Style dialog, in the List style drop-down list, choose the required list style (Figure 39).
Paragraph styles such as List 1 Start and List 1 End enable you to adjust specific properties 
(such as the space between paragraphs) for items at the beginning or end of the list.
Note
List styles are not meant to be used on their own. Rather, they are designed to be 
attached to paragraph styles.
Figure 39: Assigning a list style to a paragraph style
74 |Getting Started 24.8Creating nested lists using styles
With paragraph styles, you can easily create nested lists, in which list items have sub-items 
under them, as in an outline. This requires specifying the settings for the additional levels. To do 
this, right-click on the list style (not the paragraph style) in the Styles deck on the Sidebar, select 
Edit Style, and specify how each level will be labeled, using the Customize tab. Also specify the 
position and spacing for each level on the Position tab. Refer to the Writer Guide for details.
Once you have set up nested lists, you can readily change the hierarchy of an item. To demote 
an item one level, position the cursor at the beginning of the line (after the bullet or number) and 
press the Tab key. To promote an item one level, press Shift+Tab.
Creating lists with direct formatting
Creating unordered and ordered lists
Bullets and numbers can be manually applied in three ways:
• Use AutoCorrect to autoformat text, as described above
• Use the Toggle Unordered List  and Toggle Ordered List  buttons on the Formatting 
toolbar
• Use the Paragraph panel of the Sidebar’s Properties deck
Bullets and numbering can be applied to already selected text or they can be applied as you 
type.
Tip
Bullets and numbering applied in these ways cannot be removed with Format > 
Clear Direct Formatting  on the Menu bar, or with the Clear Direct Formatting  icon 
on the Formatting toolbar, or by using Ctrl+M. Rather, they are turned off or 
removed from selected text by toggling the relevant buttons on the Formatting 
toolbar, or on the Sidebar’s Properties deck.
Creating nested lists
Use the buttons on the Bullets and Numbering toolbar to move items up or down the list, create 
sub-items, change the style of bullets, and access the Bullets and Numbering dialog, which 
contains more detailed controls. Use View > Toolbars > Bullets and Numbering  to see the 
toolbar.
Tip
If numbering or bullets are being applied automatically in a way that you do not want,  
you can disable them by going to Tools > AutoCorrect > AutoCorrect Options  and 
deselecting Bulleted and Numbered List  on the Options tab.
The Toggle Unordered List  and Toggle Ordered List  buttons on the Sidebar’s Properties deck  
can also be used to create nested lists. Click the down arrow next to the relevant button, then 
click More Bullets/Numbering  to access the Bullets and Numbering dialog. However, the 
Sidebar does not include tools for promoting and demoting items in the list, as found on the 
Bullets and Numbering toolbar.
Setting tab stops and indents
The horizontal ruler shows the tab stops. Any tab stops that you have defined will overwrite the 
default tab stops. Tab settings affect indentation of full paragraphs (using the Increase Indent 
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 75and Decrease Indent buttons on the Formatting toolbar) as well as indentation of parts of a 
paragraph (by pressing the Tab key on the keyboard).
Using the default tab spacing can cause formatting problems if you share documents with other 
people. If you use the default tab spacing and then send the document to someone else who 
has chosen a different default tab spacing, tabbed material will change to use the other person’s 
settings. Instead of using the defaults, define your own tab settings, as described in this section.
To define indents and tab settings for one or more selected paragraphs, right-click and choose 
Paragraph > Paragraph . On the Paragraph dialog, go to the Tabs tab.
A better strategy is to define tabs for the paragraph style. This is done on the Tabs tab of the 
Paragraph Style dialog.
Tip
Using tabs to space out material on a page is not recommended. Depending on what  
you are trying to accomplish, a table or frame might be a better choice.
Changing the default tab stop interval
Caution
Any changes to the default tab setting will affect the existing default tab stops in any 
document you open afterward, as well as tab stops you insert after making the 
change.
To set the spacing of default tab stop intervals, go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice Writer > 
General.
Figure 40: Selecting a default tab stop interval
Changing measurement units for tab stops and rulers
Change the measurement unit for rulers in the current document by right-clicking on the ruler to 
open a list of units. Click on one of them to change the ruler to that unit. The selected setting 
applies only to that ruler.
Figure 41: Changing the measurement unit for a ruler
76 |Getting Started 24.8Hyphenating words
You can hyphenate words at the end of a line in two ways: let Writer do it automatically (using 
styles and its hyphenation dictionaries), or insert soft hyphens manually where needed. Or, you 
can choose to not hyphenate at all.
Automatic hyphenation using styles
To turn automatic hyphenation of words on or off:
1) On the Styles deck on the Sidebar, go to Paragraph Styles, right-click on Default 
Paragraph Style (or another style you want to use) and select Edit Style.
2) On the Paragraph Style dialog (Figure 42), go to the Text Flow tab.
3) Under Hyphenation, select or deselect Automatically. When automatic hyphenation is 
on, you can also set the criteria for when it should occur. Click OK to save.
Note
Turning on hyphenation for the Default Paragraph Style affects all other paragraph 
styles that are based on Default Paragraph Style. You can individually change other 
styles so that hyphenation is not active; for example, you might not want headings to 
be hyphenated.
Any styles not based on Default Paragraph Style are not affected. See Chapter 4, 
Working with Styles, Templates, and Hyperlinks, for more about styles based on 
styles other than Default Paragraph Style.
Figure 42: Turning on automatic hyphenation in a paragraph style
Setting hyphenation with Writing Aids
You can also set hyphenation options through Tools > Options > Languages and Locales  > 
Writing Aids. These choices apply when there is no specific setting in a paragraph style.
In Options, near the bottom of the dialog, scroll down to find the hyphenation settings.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 77Figure 43: Setting hyphenation options
To change the minimum number of characters for hyphenation, or the minimum number of 
characters before or after a line break, select the item, and then click the Edit button in the 
Options section.
Note
Hyphenation options set in Writing Aids are effective only if hyphenation is turned on 
through paragraph styles.
Manual hyphenation
Manually hyphenate words when you want only a specific word hyphenated at the end of a line. 
Do not use a normal hyphen, which will remain visible even if the word is no longer at the end of 
a line when you add or delete text, or change margins or font size. Instead, use a soft hyphen, 
which is visible only when required.
To insert a soft hyphen inside a word, click where you want the hyphen to appear (when needed)  
and press Ctrl+hyphen or use Insert > Formatting Mark > Soft Hyphen . When the word is at 
the end of the line it will be hyphenated at this position, even if automatic hyphenation for this 
paragraph is switched off.
Formatting pages
Every page in Writer is based on a page style. Page styles define basic layout, including page 
size, margins, headers and footers, borders, backgrounds, and so on. Changes to these settings  
automatically change the page style. This means that, in contrast to paragraph styles, these 
settings cannot be used to directly format individual pages.
As with other styles, Writer comes with a number of page styles. You can modify these styles or 
create new ones. The Default Page Style is used when no other page style has been specified.
In addition to page styles, several features enable you to further control page layouts, including 
columns, frames, tables, and sections. For more information, see the Writer Guide.
Tip
Page layout is usually easier if you show text, object, table, and section boundaries 
in Tools > Options > LibreOffice > Application Colors , and paragraph ends, tabs, 
breaks, and other items in Tools > Options > LibreOffice Writer > Formatting 
Aids.
Creating headers and footers
A header is an area that appears at the top of a page above the margin. A footer appears at the 
bottom of the page below the margin. Information such as a page number is placed in the 
header or footer of a page style. That information is then displayed on every page with the same 
page style (unless the page style specifies separate settings for the first page or for left and right  
pages).
78 |Getting Started 24.8Inserting a header or footer
You can insert a header in several ways. Here is the easiest:
• Click above the top margin (or below the bottom margin) to make the Header or Footer 
marker appear (Figure 44), and then click on the + sign.
Figure 44: Header marker at top of text area
After a header/footer has been created, a down-arrow appears on the marker. Click on this 
arrow to drop down a menu of choices for working with the header (Figure 45).
Alternatively, you can choose Insert > Header and Footer > Header > Default Page Style  (or 
some other page style, if not Default Page Style).
Figure 45: Header menu
Displaying different headers on right and left pages
Page styles can be set up to have the facing left and right pages mirrored or only right (first 
pages of chapters are often defined to be right-page only) or only left. When you insert a header 
on a page style set up for mirrored pages or right-and-left pages, you can have the contents of 
the header be the same on all pages or be different on the right and left pages. For example, 
you can put the page number on the left-hand edge of the left pages and on the right-hand edge 
of the right pages, put the document title on the right-hand page only, or make other changes.
Determining header and footer appearance
To format a header (use similar settings for a footer), you can either click on Format Header in 
the menu shown in Figure 45 or go to Format > Page Style , Header tab. Both methods take you  
to the same tab on the Page Style dialog.
Here you can specify if headings on the left and right pages should be the same or different. You  
can also specify whether the first page will have no header or a different header than other 
pages.
In this dialog, you can also turn the header on or off, set the margins, and set the spacing 
between the header and document text.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 79Figure 46: Page Style dialog, Header tab
Inserting document title in headers and footers
Information such as a document title is often put into the header or footer. These items are best 
added as fields. That way, if something (such as the name) changes, the headers and footers 
are updated automatically. Here is one common way to use fields to insert the document title into  
the header:
1) Choose File > Properties. On the Description tab, type a title for your document, and 
click the OK button.
2) Place the cursor in the header area at the top of the page.
3) Choose Insert > Field > Title . The title may appear on a gray background. The 
background does not show when printed and can be turned off in Tools > Options > 
LibreOffice > Application Colors .
For more about headers, footers, and fields, see the Writer Guide.
Numbering pages
Displaying the page number
To display page numbers automatically:
1) Insert a header or footer as described in “ Creating headers and footers ” on page 87.
2) Place the cursor in the header or footer where you want the page number to appear and 
choose Insert > Page Number .
3) Change the alignment of the number if you wish (left, right, or center).
Including the total number of pages
To include the total number of pages (as in “page 1 of 12”):
1) Type the word “page” and a space, then insert the page number as above.
2) Press the space bar once, type the word “of” and a space, then choose Insert > Field > 
Page Count.
80 |Getting Started 24.8Note
The Page Count field inserts the total number of pages in the document, as shown 
on the Statistics tab of the document’s Properties dialog ( File > Properties). If you 
restart page numbering anywhere in the document, then the total page count may 
not be what you want. See the Writer Guide for more information.
Restarting page numbering
Often you will want to restart the page numbering at 1, for example on the page following a title 
page or a table of contents. In addition, many documents have the “front matter” (such as the 
table of contents) numbered with Roman numerals and the main body of the document 
numbered in Arabic numerals, starting with 1. To restart page numbering:
Place the cursor in the first paragraph of the new page.
1) Choose Format > Paragraph .
2) On the Text Flow tab of the Paragraph dialog (Figure 42 on page 86), select Insert in the 
Breaks area, and then select With page style and specify the page style to use.
3) Specify the page number to start from, and then click OK.
Tip
This is also useful for numbering the first page of a document with a page number 
greater than 1.
Line numbering
Line numbers in the margin are often used in legal documents, poetry, and lists of programming 
code. Writer can insert line numbers in an entire document or for selected paragraphs. Line 
numbers are included when you print the document.
You can choose how many lines are numbered (for example, every line or every tenth line), the 
numbering type, and whether numbers restart on each page.
To add line numbers to a document, choose Tools > Line Numbering  and select the Show 
numbering option in the top left corner of the Line Numbering dialog. Then select any options 
you want and click OK.
You can also create a paragraph style that includes line numbering, and apply it to the 
paragraphs that you want to add line numbers to. For example, to number the lines of example 
code in a document, you will probably want to use a font or indentation that is different from 
normal text.
Changing page margins
You can change page margins in three ways:
• Using the page rulers — quick and easy, but does not allow fine control.
• Using the Page Style dialog — you can specify margins with precision of up to two 
decimal places.
• Using the Page deck of the Sidebar.
Caution
When you change the margins, the page style is also changed and the changed 
margins apply to all pages using that style.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 81To change margins using the rulers:
1) The gray sections of the rulers are the margins. Put the mouse pointer over the line 
between the gray and white sections. The pointer turns into a double-headed arrow and 
displays the current setting in a tool-tip.
2) Hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse to move the margin.
Caution
The two small gray triangles on the ruler are used for indenting paragraphs. The 
double-headed arrows shown in Figure 47 are mouse pointers shown in the correct 
position for moving the margin markers. Because the triangles and arrows are often 
in the same place, when changing page margins you need to be careful to move the 
arrows, not the gray triangles.
Figure 47: Moving the margins
To change margins using the Page Style dialog:
1) Right-click anywhere in the text area on the page and select Page Style in the context 
menu.
2) On the Page tab of the dialog, type the required distances in the boxes in the Margins 
area.
To change margins using the Page deck of the Sidebar:
1) On the Sidebar, open the Page deck.
2) On the Format panel, use the Margins drop-down list to select the desired margins from 
the defaults provided. Click the More Options button to open the Page Style dialog 
where you can enter exact margin distances.
Note
The margin selections on the Sidebar change all four margins to be the same. If you 
require different margins, you need to use the Page Style dialog.
Choosing a page background
You can apply backgrounds to many elements in Writer, including pages. On the Area tab of the 
Page Style dialog, choose a background type (color, gradient, bitmap, pattern, or hatch). On the 
Page tab of the dialog, you can choose whether the background covers only the text area (the 
area inside the margins) or the entire page. For more about backgrounds, see the Writer Guide.
82 |Getting Started 24.8Adding a custom watermark to the page background
To add a watermark to a page background:
1) Choose Format > Watermark .
2) In the Watermark dialog (Figure 48), type the text and select the font, angle, 
transparency and color of the watermark. Then click OK.
Note
The watermark will automatically become part of the page style where it is inserted 
and all other pages of the same style will have the watermark. Pages with different or  
no watermarks need different Page Styles for those pages.
Figure 48: The Watermark dialog
Defining a different first page for a document
Many documents, such as letters and memos, have a first page that is different from the other 
pages in the document. For example, the first page of a letterhead typically has a different 
header, or the first page of a report might have no header or footer, while the other pages do.
You can do this in several ways, as described in the Writer Guide:
• Use the Default Page Style (or any other page style) for your document. Deselect the 
Same content on first page  option on the Header/Footer tabs in the Page Style dialog, 
and then add different headers/footers to the first page and to the other pages of the 
document.
• Use different page styles for the first page and for the following pages. Set the Next 
Page attribute for the first page so the next page automatically becomes the style for 
following pages.
• Add a title page at the beginning of the document. Writer provides a fast and convenient 
way to add one or more title pages to a document and optionally to restart the page 
number at 1 for the body of the document, using Format > Title Page  on the Menu bar.
Adding comments to a document
Authors and reviewers often use comments to exchange ideas, ask for suggestions, or mark 
items needing attention.
You can connect a comment to multiple paragraphs or a single point. To insert a comment, 
select the text, or place the cursor in the place the comment refers to, and choose Insert > 
Comment on the menu bar, click the Insert Comment icon on the Standard toolbar,  or press 
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 83Ctrl+Alt+C. The anchor point of the comment is connected by a dotted line to a box on the 
right-hand side of the page where you can type the text of the comment. A Comments button is 
also added to the right of the horizontal ruler at the top of the page; you can click this button to 
toggle the display of the comments.
Formatting comments
At the bottom of the comment, Writer automatically adds the author’s name and a time stamp 
indicating when the comment was created. If more than one person edits the document, each 
author is automatically allocated a different background color. Figure 49 shows an example of 
text with comments from two different authors.
Figure 49: Example of comments
Choose Tools > Options > LibreOffice > User Data  to provide the name you want to appear in 
the Author field of comments.
Right-click on a comment to open a context menu where you can delete the current comment or 
whore current commend thread, all the comments from the same author, or all the comments in 
the document. On this menu, you can also reply to a comment, open a dialog to apply some 
basic formatting to the text, and mark comments as Resolved. These options are also available 
on a drop-down menu accessed by clicking the down arrow icon at the bottom right of the 
comment.
Navigating through comments
To navigate from one comment to another, open the sidebar Navigator, expand the Comments 
section, and click on the comment text to move the cursor to the anchor point of the comment in 
the document. Click the comment directly to edit it and right-click on the comment to delete it.
You can also navigate through the comments using the keyboard. Use Ctrl+Alt+Page Down to 
move to the next comment and Ctrl+Alt+Page Up to move to the previous comment.
Printing comments
When a document contains comments, the print dialog has an option for comments to be printed  
next to the text in the right margin, as they appear on the screen. In that case, the text on each 
page is scaled down to make space for the comments. The Print dialog also has options for 
placing comments at the end of the page or at the end of the document, or for printing only the 
comments.
Using built-in language tools
Writer provides some tools that make work easier if you use more than one language in the 
same document or if you write documents in various languages. Changing the language for 
84 |Getting Started 24.8specific text enables you to use the correct dictionaries and rules to check spelling, grammar, 
and hyphenation. It also applies the localized versions of AutoCorrect replacement options and 
uses the appropriate thesaurus.
Options for applying languages
Tip
The language used at the location of the cursor is shown in the Status bar, next to 
the page style in use.
Using styles
Languages can be set on the Font tab of the Paragraph Style dialog or the Character Style 
dialog. See the Writer Guide for information on how to manage the language settings of a style.
Caution
Be careful when changing a language in character or paragraph styles, as this will 
change the language for all characters or paragraphs using that style. It may be 
useful to include the language in the name of the style.
Languages set with direct formatting will override languages set using styles.
Using direct formatting
The language of a whole document can be set by using Tools > Options > Languages and 
Locales > General. In the Default Languages for Documents  section, you can choose the 
language for all the text that is not explicitly marked as a different language.
Set the language for the whole document, for individual paragraphs, or even for individual words 
and characters, in Tools > Language  on the Menu bar, and select For Selection, For 
Paragraph or For All Text. If the required language is not available in the submenu, click More. 
The Tools > Options > Languages and Locales  > General menu opens, where you can select  
the language as described above.
Alternatively, you can set the language for individual paragraphs and characters by selecting text  
or putting the cursor in a paragraph and changing the language on the Status bar. There is also 
an option More, in case the text is not directly available.
Note
Although these methods are a type of direct formatting, they cannot be cleared by 
using Format > Clear Direct Formatting  on the Menu bar, clicking the Clear Direct 
Formatting icon on the Formatting toolbar, selecting Clear Direct Formatting  in the 
context menu, or using Ctrl+M.
Preventing text from being checked for spelling
You can set the language for a paragraph or a group of characters as None (Do not check 
spelling) using any of the methods described above. This option is especially useful for text 
such as web addresses or programming language snippets that you do not want to check for 
spelling.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 85Obtaining resources for additional languages
The spelling checker works only for those languages in the Spelling dialog list that have a 
dictionary installed. You can install additional dictionaries using Get more dictionaries online  at 
the bottom of the Tools > Language > Writing Aids  dialog.
Creating a table of contents
Writer can generate a table of contents from the headings in your document. Before you start, 
make sure that the headings are styled consistently. For example, you can use the Heading 1 
style for chapter titles and the Heading 2 and Heading 3 styles for chapter subheadings.
Although tables of contents can be customized extensively in Writer, often the default settings 
are all you need. Creating a quick table of contents is simple:
1) When you create your document, use the following paragraph styles for hierarchical 
heading levels (such as chapter and section headings): Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 
3, and so on. These headings are what will appear in your table of contents.
2) Place the cursor where you want the table of contents to appear.
3) Choose Insert > Table of Contents and Index > Table of Contents, Index or 
Bibliography.
4) Change nothing in the Table of Contents, Index, or Bibliography dialog (unless you want 
to change the number of levels shown). Click OK.
If you add or delete text (so that headings move to different pages) or you add, delete, or change  
headings, you need to update the table of contents. To do this, right-click anywhere within the 
table of contents and choose Update index in the context menu.
You can define your own heading styles and set them up in Tools > Heading Numbering . You 
can also include other paragraph styles in the table of contents by assigning outline levels to 
those styles on the Outline & List tab of the paragraph style dialog.
You can customize an existing table of contents at any time. Right-click anywhere in it and 
choose Edit Index in the context menu. The Writer Guide describes in detail all the 
customization options you can choose.
Creating indexes and bibliographies
Indexes and bibliographies work in a similar way to tables of contents. In addition to alphabetical  
indexes, other types of index supplied with Writer include those for illustrations, tables, and 
objects.
You can also create a user-defined index. For example, you might want an index containing only 
the scientific names of species mentioned in the text, and a separate index containing only the 
common names of species.
Before creating an index, you first need to create index entries in your Writer document. The 
Writer Guide describes how to do this.
Using footnotes and endnotes
Footnotes appear at the bottom of the page on which they are referenced. Endnotes are 
collected at the end of a document.
To work effectively with footnotes and endnotes, you need to:
• Insert footnotes and define their format.
86 |Getting Started 24.8To insert a footnote or an endnote, put the cursor where you want the footnote or 
endnote marker to appear. Then select Insert > Footnote and Endnote  on the Menu 
bar and choose Footnote or Endnote, or click the Insert Footnote or Insert Endnote 
button on the Standard toolbar.
A footnote or endnote marker is inserted in the text and, depending on your choice, the 
cursor is relocated either to the footnote area at the bottom of the page or to the endnote 
area at the end of the document. Type the footnote or endnote content in this area.
To format the footnotes themselves, select Tools > Footnote/Endnote Settings . On the 
Settings of Footnotes and Endnotes dialog, choose settings as required.
See the Writer Guide for more details.
• Define the location of footnotes on the page, and the color and line styles for separator 
lines, if the defaults do not meet your needs. These are found on the Footnote tab of the 
Page Style dialog; see the Writer Guide.
Inserting material from other documents
You may wish to reuse material from other files in the document you are writing. For example, 
you might be writing a set of instructions that include some common paragraphs. You could, of 
course, retype or copy and paste the common paragraphs into each document. However, if the 
common paragraphs are edited, you may need to update that information in every document 
where it occurs.
Writer provides some tools for making these tasks easier. For details, see the Writer Guide.
• The Section dialog.
• Two items in the Navigator’s drag modes: Insert as Link and Insert as Copy.
Working with images (graphics)
Images in Writer are of these basic types:
• Image files, including photos, drawings, and scanned images
• Diagrams created using LibreOffice’s drawing tools
• Artwork created using clip art or Fontwork
• Charts created using LibreOffice’s Chart facility
See Chapter 5, Working with Images and Graphics, in this book and the Writer Guide.
Working with tables
Tables are a useful way to organize and present large amounts of information. In addition to 
using tables for text or numbers, you could put other objects, such as pictures, in cells. Writer’s 
tables can often be used as an alternative to spreadsheets, and they provide limited 
spreadsheet functions.
To directly insert a table with the default properties, click the Insert Table icon on the Standard 
toolbar. On the drop-down graphic, choose the size of the table.
To insert a new table using the Insert Table dialog, where you can specify the properties for the 
table, position the cursor where you want the table to appear, then use any of the following 
methods to open the dialog:
• Choose Table > Insert Table  on the Menu bar.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 87• Press Ctrl+F12.
• On the Standard toolbar, click the Insert Table icon and select More Options at the 
bottom of the drop-down graphic.
Writer provides many methods to format tables and the contents of cells. Refer to the Writer 
Guide.
Printing and exporting to PDF or EPUB
See Chapter 10, Working with File Formats, Security, and Exporting, in this book and the Writer 
Guide for details on:
• Previewing pages before printing, selecting print options, printing in black and white on a  
color printer, printing brochures, and other printing features.
• Exporting a Writer document to PDF (Portable Document Format) or EPUB (a popular 
ebook format).
Using mail merge
Writer provides very useful features to create and print:
• Multiple copies of a document to send to a list of different recipients (form letters)
• Mailing labels
• Envelopes
All these features use data from a registered data source (a spreadsheet or database containing  
name and address records or other information). The Writer Guide describes the merge 
processes.
Tracking changes to a document
You can use several methods to keep track of changes made to a document. Details are in the 
Writer Guide.
Method 1 (Recommended)
Use Writer’s change marks (often called “redlines” or “revision marks”) to show added or deleted  
material or changed formatting. Comments can be recorded to explain the changes; these are 
handled a bit differently from the comments discussed in “ Adding comments to a document ” on 
page 92.
1) Open the document and choose Edit > Track Changes > Record  before starting to edit.
2) Later, you or another person can review and accept or reject each change. Choose Edit 
> Track Changes > Show . Right-click on an individual change and choose Accept 
Change or Reject Change in the context menu. Alternatively, choose Edit > Track 
Changes > Manage  or open the Manage Changes deck on the Sidebar to view the list 
of changes and accept or reject them. You can also use the icons on the Track Changes 
toolbar.
88 |Getting Started 24.8Method 2
Make your changes to a copy of the document (stored in a different folder, or under a different 
name, or both), then use Writer to combine the two files and show the differences. Choose Edit 
> Track Changes > Compare Document  or Edit > Track Changes > Merge Document .
Method 3
Save versions that are stored as part of the original file. However, this method can cause 
problems with documents of non-trivial size or complexity, especially if you save a lot of versions.
Note
Not all changes are recorded. For example, changing a tab stop from align left to 
align right, and changes in formulas (equations) or linked graphics are not recorded.
Tip
In addition to the Edit > Track Changes  menu, Writer provides the same commands  
on the Track Changes toolbar ( View > Toolbars > Track Changes ).
Caution
A document with track changes activated but with the changes not shown carries an 
invisible history of document editing that the current user may not be aware of. 
Contents deleted or modified can be recovered. While this is a feature, it is also a 
potential privacy risk.
Using fields
Fields are extremely useful features of Writer. You can use them for data that changes (such as 
the current date or the total number of pages) and for inserting document properties such as 
name, author, and date of last update. Fields are the basis of cross-referencing (see below); 
automatic numbering of figures, tables, headings, and other elements; and a wide range of other  
functions. See the Writer Guide for details.
Linking and cross-referencing within a document
Writer provides three ways to manage references within a document: hyperlinks, cross-
references, and bookmarks 
• Hyperlinks: Refers the user or the document to specific files. A hyperlink can direct the 
user to a URL that is opened with the default browser or allow the document to open files  
from a filesystem.
• Cross-references: Uses fields to manage the automatic numbering of figures, tables, 
headings, and other elements; and a wide range of other functions. See the Writer Guide 
for details.
• Bookmarks: Allows users to move quickly between different parts of a document. You 
can cross-reference to bookmarks and create hyperlinks to bookmarks, as described in 
the Writer Guide. 
If you save a Writer document to HTML, hyperlinks remain active but cross-references do not. 
Both remain active when the document is exported to PDF.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 89Using hyperlinks
See Chapter 4, Working with Styles, Templates, and Hyperlinks, for details on creating 
hyperlinks within a document and to other documents and websites.
Creating and using cross-references
The Cross-references tab of the Fields dialog lists some items, such as headings, bookmarks, 
figures, tables, or numbered items such as steps in a procedure. You can also create your own 
reference items; see the Writer Guide.
To insert a cross-reference:
1) In the document, place the cursor where you want the cross-reference to appear.
2) If the Fields dialog is not open, click Insert > Cross-reference . On the Cross-references 
tab (Figure 50), in the Type list, select the type of item to be referenced (for example, 
Headings or Figure).
3) Click on the required item in the Selection list, which shows all the items of the selected 
type. You can type some characters in the top box under Selection to filter the list in the 
selection box.
Figure 50: The Cross-references tab of the Fields dialog
4) In the Refer using: list, select the option needed. The options determine the text inserted 
for the hyperlink and how it is formatted. The list varies according to the Type chosen. 
The most commonly used options are Referenced text (the full text of a heading or 
caption), Category and Number  (a figure or table number preceded by the word Figure or  
Table, but without the caption text), Number (the figure or table number, without the word 
Figure or Table), or Page number (styled)  (to insert the number of the page the 
referenced text is on).
5) Click Insert.
90 |Getting Started 24.8You can leave this dialog open while you insert many cross-references.
Using bookmarks
You can use bookmarks to rapidly navigate or link to specific locations in a document. They are 
listed in the Navigator and can be accessed directly from there with a single mouse click. You 
can cross-reference to bookmarks and create hyperlinks to bookmarks, as described above.
To create a bookmark:
1) Select the text you want to bookmark. Click Insert > Bookmark .
2) On the Insert Bookmark dialog, the larger box lists any previously defined bookmarks. 
Type a name for this new bookmark in the top box, and then click Insert.
Text enclosed by a bookmark can be edited in the Bookmark dialog as well as in the document 
itself. When you edit text in the dialog, it is also edited in the document. If you have change 
tracking on, the change is tracked in the document.
Using master documents
A master document joins separate text documents into one larger document, and unifies the 
formatting, table of contents, bibliography, index, and other tables or lists. Master documents are  
typically used for producing long documents such as a book, thesis, or long report. They are 
especially handy when different people are writing different sections of a document, eliminating 
the need to continually share the full document. For details on using master documents, see the 
Writer Guide.
Creating fill-in forms
In a standard text document, such as a report, any text can be edited. By contrast, a form has 
sections that are not to be edited, and other sections that are designed for the reader to fill in 
information or make selections. For example, a questionnaire has an introduction and questions 
(which do not change) and spaces for the reader to enter answers.
Forms are used in three ways:
• To create a simple document for the recipient to complete, such as a questionnaire sent 
out to a group of people who fill it in and return it.
• To enter information directly into a database or data source. Someone taking orders 
might enter the information for each order into a database using a form.
• To view information held in a database or data source. A librarian might call up 
information about books.
Writer offers several ways to organize information fields in a form, including check boxes, option 
buttons, text boxes, pull-down lists, and spinners. Two toolbars are used to create forms: Form 
Controls and Form Design. See the Writer Guide for more information.
Using content controls
Content controls are placeholders. You can add and customize content controls for use in 
templates, forms, and documents. Content controls can provide instructions on their use. Some 
are similar to the older form controls, but can be easier to work with and format. However, unlike 
form fields, content controls do not connect to any data in a database. See the Writer Guide for 
more information.
Chapter 2,  Getting Started with Writer  | 91Determining document accessibility
Writer can analyze a document and determine whether it has accessibility problems. To obtain 
this information, open the Sidebar and click on the Accessibility Check deck For more 
information about accessibility checking,  see the Writer Guide.
92 |Getting Started 24.8 
Chapter 3, 
Getting Started with Calc
Using spreadsheets in LibreOfficeWhat is Calc?
Calc is the spreadsheet component of LibreOffice. You can enter data (usually numerical) in a 
spreadsheet and then manipulate this data to discover results.
Other features provided by Calc include:
• Functions, which can be used to create formulas to perform complex calculations on 
data.
• Database functions, to arrange, store, and filter data.
• Data statistics tools, to perform complex data analysis.
• Dynamic charts, including a wide range of 2D and 3D charts.
• Macros, for recording and executing repetitive tasks; scripting languages supported 
include LibreOffice Basic, Python, BeanShell, and JavaScript.
• Ability to open, edit, and save Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.
• Import and export of spreadsheets in multiple formats, including HTML, CSV, PDF, and 
DIF.
• Seamless collaboration with other users by sharing spreadsheets.
Compatibility with other spreadsheet applications
Wildcards
Simple wildcards such as the asterisk (*), question mark (?), and tilde (~) from other spreadsheet  
applications are recognized by Calc in formula expressions.
Formula syntax
By default, Calc uses its own formula syntax, referred to as Calc A1, rather than the default 
Excel A1 syntax used by Microsoft Excel. Calc will translate seamlessly between the two. 
However, if you are familiar with Excel you may wish to change the default syntax by going to 
Tools > Options > LibreOffice Calc > Formula and choosing Excel A1 or Excel R1C1 in the 
Formula syntax drop-down menu.
For more information on formula syntax, see Chapter 8, Using Formulas and Functions, in the 
Calc Guide.
Macros
Microsoft Office uses Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code, and LibreOffice uses Basic code 
based on the LibreOffice API. Although the programming languages are the same, the objects 
and methods are different and therefore not entirely compatible.
LibreOffice can run some Excel Visual Basic scripts if you enable this feature at Tools > 
Options > Load/Save > VBA Properties .
If you want to use macros written in Microsoft Excel using the VBA macro code in LibreOffice, 
you must first edit the code in the LibreOffice Basic IDE editor.
For more information, refer to Chapter 13, Macros, in the Calc Guide.
Functions
For many functions, Calc follows the OpenFormula standard defined in the Recalculated 
Formula (OpenFormula) Format  part of the Open Document Format for Office Applications 
94 |Getting Started 24.8(OpenDocument) standard, which can be accessed at the OASIS website ( https://www.oasis-
open.org/). Calc’s general support for OpenFormula leads to a level of inherent compatibility with  
the function set of any other spreadsheet application that follows the same standard. Note that 
there are some functions within Calc that are not in accordance with OpenFormula, but many of 
these are included specifically to improve the exchange of files between Calc and Microsoft 
Excel.
Spreadsheets, sheets, and cells
Calc uses spreadsheets, which consist of a number of individual sheets. Each sheet contains 
cells arranged in rows and columns, and each cell is identified by its row number and column 
letter.
Cells hold the individual elements – text, numbers, formulas, and so on – that make up the data 
to display and manipulate.
Each spreadsheet can have up to 10,000 sheets, and each sheet can have a maximum of 
1,048,576 rows and a maximum of 16,384 columns.
Calc main window
When Calc is started, the main window opens (Figure 51). The parts of this window are 
described below. You can show or hide many of the parts as desired, using the View menu on 
the Menu bar.
Note
By default, Calc’s commands are grouped in menus and toolbars, as described in 
this chapter. In addition, Calc provides other user interface variations, displaying 
contextual groups of commands and contents. For more information, see Chapter 
16, User Interface Variants, in the Calc Guide.
Title bar
The Title bar, located at the top, shows the name of the current spreadsheet. When a 
spreadsheet is newly created from a template or a blank document, its name is Untitled X, where 
X is a number. When you save a spreadsheet for the first time, you are prompted to enter a 
name of your choice.
Menu bar
Under the Title bar is the Menu bar. When you select one of the menu items, a sub-menu drops 
down to show commands. You can also customize the Menu bar; see Chapter 13, Customizing 
LibreOffice, for more information.
Most of the menus are similar to those in other components of LibreOffice, although the specific 
commands and tools may vary. The menus specific to Calc are Sheet and Data; in addition, 
several important data analysis tools are found in the Tools menu and the View menu contains 
several options that are of specific interest to Calc users.
Sheet
Commands for handling sheets, including options for inserting and deleting elements; 
renaming, moving, and copying sheets; changing a sheet tab’s highlight color; and 
navigating through multiple sheets.
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 95Figure 51: Calc main window
Data
Commands for manipulating and analyzing data, including options for sorting and 
filtering; defining database ranges; creating pivot tables; defining validity rules; creating 
subtotals; consolidating; grouping and outlining; and performing various types of 
statistical analysis.
Tools
Commands for checking and customizing the spreadsheet, including options for spell 
checking; defining AutoCorrect preferences; applying Goal Seek; using the Solver to 
solve mathematical equations by goal-seeking methods; using the Detective to 
investigate dependencies between cells; creating scenarios; sharing and protecting; and 
using macros.
View
Commands of particular interest to Calc users include Value Highlighting; Column/Row 
Highlighting; Hidden Row/Column Indicator; and Show Formula.
Toolbars
In a default LibreOffice installation, the top toolbar under the Menu bar is called the Standard 
toolbar. It is consistent across all LibreOffice applications. For more information about toolbars, 
see Chapter 1, LibreOffice Basics.
Formula bar
The Formula bar (Figure 52) is located at the top of the cell grid in the Calc workspace. It is 
permanently docked in this position and cannot be used as a floating toolbar. However, it can be 
hidden or made visible by going to View > Formula Bar  on the Menu bar.
Figure 52: Formula bar
96 |Getting Started 24.8From left to right, the Formula bar includes the following:
Name Box
Displays the current active cell reference using a combination of a letter and a number, 
for example A1. The letter indicates the column and the number indicates the row of the 
selected cell. If you have selected a range of cells that is also a named range, the name 
of the range is shown in this box. You can also jump to a specific cell by typing a cell 
reference in the Name Box. If you type the name of a named range and press the Enter 
key, the named range is selected and displayed.
Function Wizard
Opens a dialog from which you can search through lists of available functions. This can 
be very useful because it also shows how the functions are formatted.
Select Function
This drop-down list provides the options shown in Figure 53 to perform calculations on 
cells containing numbers.
Figure 53: Select Function drop-down
Formula
Inserts an equals (=) sign into the selected cell and the Input line, allowing a formula to 
be entered. The Name Box now displays a drop-down list of the most frequently used 
functions, for a quick access to the function name and syntax.
Input line
Displays the contents of the selected cell (data, formula, or function) and allows you to 
edit the cell contents. To turn it into a multi-line input area for very long formulas, click the  
down arrow on the right-hand side of the Input line.
You can also directly edit the contents of a cell by double-clicking on the cell. When you enter or 
edit data in a cell, the Select Function and Formula icons change to Cancel and Accept icons.
Note
In a spreadsheet, the term “function” covers much more than just mathematical 
functions. See Chapter 8, Using Formulas and Functions, in the Calc Guide for more 
information.
Status bar
The Status bar (Figure 54) provides information about the spreadsheet as well as quick and 
convenient ways to change some of its features. Most of the fields are similar to those in other 
components of LibreOffice. See Chapter 1, LibreOffice Basics, for more information.

The Status bar can allow you to do quick math operations on selected cells. You can view the 
calculated average and sum, count of elements, and more on the selection by right-clicking over 
the Cell/Object Information area and selecting the operations you want to display in the Status 
bar (Figure 55).
Figure 55: Selecting math operations on Status bar
Sidebar
The Sidebar (View > Sidebar or Ctrl+F5) is located on the right-hand side of the window. It is 
similar to the Sidebar in Writer (shown in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of this book) and consists of 
five decks: Properties, Styles, Gallery, Navigator, and Functions. Each deck has a 
corresponding icon on the Tab panel on the right-hand side of the Sidebar, allowing you to switch  
between them. The decks are described below.
Properties
With a cell selected, this deck includes five content panels. Each of these panels has a 
More Options button that opens a dialog with additional options. These dialogs lock the 
spreadsheet for editing until they are closed.
Style: Options for applying, creating, and updating cell styles.
Character: Options for formatting the text, such as font name, size, weight, and color. 
Some controls, such as superscript, become active only when the text cursor is active in 
the Input line of the Formula bar or the cell. A font is temporarily applied on selected cells  
when hovering or navigating in the Font Name list.
Number Format: Options for formatting numbers, including decimals, percentages, 
currency, and dates. Covers decimal places, leading zeroes, coloring negative numbers, 
and displaying thousands separators.
98 |Getting Started 24.8Alignment: Options for arranging the text in various ways, including horizontal and 
vertical alignment, wrapping, indenting, orientation, and vertical stacking. Also provides 
for cell merging.
Cell Appearance: Options for controlling the appearance of cells, including background 
color and border formats.
The set of panels displayed in this deck depends on the type of object that is currently 
selected. For example, with a chart selected, the Properties deck contains Line, Position 
and Size, Area, and Shadow panels. Not all panels in the Properties deck provide a 
More Options button.
Styles, Gallery, Navigator
These decks are similar to those in Writer. Their use is described in the Calc Guide. Note 
that Calc supports three style types – cell styles, page styles, and drawing styles.
Functions
This deck contains a searchable list of functions organized by category. It is a simpler 
version of the Function Wizard, which is opened by selecting Insert > Function on the 
Menu bar, clicking the Function Wizard icon on the Formula bar, or pressing Ctrl+F2.
Spreadsheet layout
Individual cells
The main section of the Calc workspace displays the cells in the form of a grid. Each cell is 
formed by the intersection of one column and one row in the spreadsheet.
At the top of the columns and the left of the rows are a series of header boxes containing letters 
and numbers. The column headers use alphabetic characters beginning at A and go on to the 
right (to column XFD). The row headers use numerical characters starting at 1 and go down.
These column and row headers form the cell references that appear in the Name Box on the 
Formula bar (Figure 52). If the headers are not visible on the spreadsheet, choose View > View 
Headers on the Menu bar.
When the mouse pointer lies over the grid of cells, the system default pointer is normally shown 
(typically an arrow pointer). However, a configuration option is available to switch to using the 
pointer shape defined in the icon theme (typically a fat cross). For more information, see Chapter  
15, Setting up and Customizing, in the Calc Guide.
The active cell is always indicated by highlighting its corresponding column and row header 
cells. An option is available to highlight the entire row and column of the active cell using a 
transparent color. This is enabled/disabled using the Tools > Options > LibreOffice Calc > 
View > Column/Row highlighting  and View > Column/Row Highlighting  options on the Menu  
bar.
Sheet tabs
Each Calc spreadsheet can contain multiple sheets, which are displayed as tabs at the bottom of  
the spreadsheet window. By default, each new spreadsheet is created with one sheet named 
Sheet1 and you can create additional sheets as needed. The tab for the active sheet is 
highlighted and you can select multiple sheets by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking on 
the sheet tabs.
To change the default name for a sheet (Sheet1, Sheet2, and so on), right-click on a sheet tab 
and select Rename Sheet in the context menu, to open the Rename Sheet dialog where you 
can type a new name for the sheet. You can also access the Rename Sheet dialog by double-
clicking on the sheet tab or going to Sheet > Rename Sheet  on the Menu bar. 
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 99To change the color of a sheet tab, right-click on the tab and select Tab Color in the context 
menu to open the Tab Color dialog. Select a color and click OK. You can also access the Tab 
Color dialog by going to Sheet > Sheet Tab Color  on the Menu bar. To add new colors to this 
color palette, see Chapter 13, Customizing LibreOffice.
Opening and importing a CSV file
A comma-separated values (CSV) file contains data in tabular format. In many cases, CSV files 
contain data exported from a database, resulting in a file in which each line corresponds to a 
record from a table or query. You can import such data into Calc for futher analysis and charting. 
A CSV file stores data in a text format, separating values with a specific delimiter character. The 
delimiter is often a comma but may be a semicolon, a vertical bar, or any other character. Before  
you open a CSV file in Calc, make sure you know which character is the delimiter. Each line in a 
CSV file represents a row in a spreadsheet.
To open a CSV file in Calc:
1) Choose File > Open on the Menu bar, click the Open icon on the Standard toolbar, or 
press Ctrl+O, and then locate the CSV file. Most CSV files have the extension .csv but 
some CSV files may have a .txt extension.
2) Select the file and click Open.
3) On the Text Import dialog (Figure 56), select the required options for importing the CSV 
file into the Calc spreadsheet. For details about these options, see Chapter 1, 
Introduction, in the Calc Guide.
Figure 56: Text Import dialog
100 |Getting Started 24.8Tip
CSV files from different sources may adopt various formats. As you select and 
deselect options in the upper part of the Text Import dialog, use the preview area in 
the lower part of the dialog to verify that the layout of the imported data is as 
expected.
4) Click OK to import the file.
Caution
Know how your CSV file is formatted before you open it in Calc. Not knowing how 
the CSV is structured is a source for errors and miscalculations.
Saving spreadsheets
For information on how to save files manually or automatically, see Chapter 1, LibreOffice 
Basics. Calc can save spreadsheets in a range of formats and also export spreadsheets to PDF 
and XHTML file formats or JPEG, PNG, and WEBP image formats; see Chapter 7, Printing, 
Exporting, Emailing, and Signing, in the Calc Guide for more information.
Saving files in different formats
You can save a spreadsheet in another format:
1) Save the spreadsheet in Calc spreadsheet file format (*.ods).
2) Select File > Save As on the Menu bar to open the Save As dialog. You can also open 
this dialog by pressing the Ctrl+Shift+S keyboard shortcut, or by clicking the 
arrowhead icon to the right of the Save icon on the Standard toolbar and selecting Save 
As in the drop-down menu.
3) Select the folder where you want to save the file.
4) In the File name field, enter a new file name for the spreadsheet.

insert. You can also specify that the ranges or tables can be updated every n seconds. 
These tables are now listed in the order they appear in the source. Click OK to finish.
104 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 62: Link to external data
Navigating within spreadsheets
Calc provides many ways to navigate within a spreadsheet, including methods for moving from 
cell to cell and sheet to sheet.
Cell navigation
When a cell is selected or in focus, a colored rectangle is drawn around the cell. When a group 
of cells is selected, the background of the cell area is colored. The colors depend on the 
operating system being used and how you have set up LibreOffice.
Mouse: Place the mouse pointer over the cell and click the left mouse button.
Cell reference: Delete the existing cell reference in the Name Box on the Formula bar 
(Figure 52). Type the new cell reference and press Enter. Cell references are case-
insensitive.
Navigator: Open the Navigator (Figure 63) by pressing F5 or going to View > Navigator  
on the Menu bar. Type the cell reference into the Column and Row fields, or use the 
adjacent increment / decrement buttons, and press Enter. Equivalent interactions are 
available on the Navigation deck of the Sidebar.
Enter key: By default, moves the cell focus down in a column to the next row. 
Shift+Enter moves the focus up in a column to the previous row. You can change the 
action of the Enter key; see “Customizing the Enter key ” below.
Tab key: Moves the cell focus right in a row to the next column. Shift+Tab moves the 
focus to the left in a row to the previous column.
Arrow keys: Use these keys to move the cell focus in the direction of the arrow pressed.
Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys:
– Home moves the cell focus to the start of a row. Ctrl+Home moves the cell focus to the 
first cell in the sheet, A1.
– The result of pressing End or Ctrl+End depends on the data contained in the sheet. 
To explain these key presses, it is helpful to define R max as the highest numbered row 
in the sheet that contains any data and C max as the rightmost column in the sheet that 
contains any data. Press End to move the cell focus along the current row to the cell in  
column Cmax. Press Ctrl+End to move the cell focus to the cell at the intersection of 
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 105row Rmax and column Cmax. Note that in either case, the newly focused cell may not 
contain any data.
– Page Down moves the cell focus down one complete screen display.
– Page Up moves the cell focus up one complete screen display.
Figure 63: Calc Navigator
Sheet navigation
Each sheet in a spreadsheet is independent of the other sheets, though references can create 
links between one sheet to another. To navigate between sheets in a spreadsheet:
Navigator – double-click on any of the sheets listed in the Navigator to select that sheet.
Keyboard – Ctrl+Page Down moves one sheet to the right and Ctrl+Page Up moves 
one sheet to the left. Ctrl+Tab is equivalent to Ctrl+Page Down, while 
Ctrl+Shift+Tab is equivalent to Ctrl+Page Up. These interactions operate in a cyclic 
manner. For example, if currently on the first sheet tab, then Ctrl+Page Up moves to 
the last sheet tab.
Mouse – click on a sheet tab at the bottom of the spreadsheet to select that sheet.
Menu – go to Sheet > Navigate > To Previous Sheet  / To Next Sheet on the Menu bar 
to navigate to previous or next sheet. These interactions operate in the same cyclic 
manner as described above for their equivalent keyboard shortcuts. Sheet > Navigate > 
Go to Sheet brings up a dialog box that allows you to select a sheet or to search for a 
sheet by name.
If your spreadsheet contains multiple sheets, then some of the sheet tabs may be hidden. If this 
is the case:
• Using the four arrowhead buttons to the left of the sheet tabs can move the tabs into 
view (Figure 64).
• Right-clicking on any of these buttons, or the adjacent + button, opens a context menu 
where you can select a specific sheet (Figure 65).
106 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 64: Navigating sheet tabs
Figure 65: Right-click any active arrow button
Note
When you insert a new sheet into a spreadsheet, Calc automatically uses the next 
number in the numeric sequence to construct a name. To improve navigation, 
rename sheets in a spreadsheet to make them more recognizable.
Keyboard navigation
You can navigate a spreadsheet using the keyboard, by pressing a key or a combination of keys.  
See Chapter 1, Introduction, and Appendix A, Keyboard Shortcuts, in the Calc Guide for the keys 
and key combinations you can use for spreadsheet navigation in Calc.
Customizing the Enter key
You can customize the behavior of the Enter key by going to Tools > Options > LibreOffice 
Calc > General on the Menu bar and using the upper three options in the Input Settings area 
(Figure 66).
• Press Enter to move selection : check this option to choose the direction that the cell 
focus moves after you press the Enter key. Select the required direction of movement in 
the adjacent drop-down menu ( Down, Right, Up, or Left).
• Press Enter to switch to edit mode : checking this option causes Enter to open the 
highlighted cell for editing. Uncheck to make the Enter key select the adjacent cell in the  
direction of movement defined by the Press Enter to move selection  option.
• Press Enter to paste and clear clipboard : checking this option causes Enter to paste 
the content of the clipboard to the highlighted cell, subsequently clearing the clipboard.

114 |Getting Started 24.8Viewing a spreadsheet
Changing document view
Use the zoom function ( View > Zoom) to show more or fewer cells in the window when you are 
working on a spreadsheet. For more about zoom, see Chapter 1, LibreOffice Basics.
Freezing rows and columns
If you have long rows or columns of data that extend beyond the viewable area of the sheet, you  
can freeze selected rows or columns. In this way you can lock rows across the top of a sheet or 
lock columns down the left of a sheet, so that the frozen data remains displayed as you scroll 
through the rest of the data. Vertical scrolling does not affect the visibility of data in a frozen row; 
horizontal scrolling does not affect the visibility of data in a frozen column.
The sheet shown in Figure 71, has frozen rows and columns, which are outlined by heavy lines. 
Columns A through F and rows 1 through 3 are frozen. The rows between 3 and 23 and the 
columns between F and Q are scrolled off the page.
Figure 71: Frozen rows and columns
To freeze the first column in a sheet go to View > Freeze Cells > Freeze First Column  on the 
Menu bar, or click the down arrow to the right of the Freeze Rows and Column  icon on the 
Standard toolbar and select Freeze First Column  in the drop-down menu.
To freeze the first row in a sheet go to View > Freeze Cells > Freeze First Row  on the Menu 
bar, or click the down arrow to the right of the Freeze Rows and Column  icon on the Standard 
toolbar and select Freeze First Row in the drop-down menu.
To freeze either a set of rows or a set of column s (single or multiple):
1) Click on the header of the row below all the rows you want to freeze, or click on the 
header of the column to the right of all the columns you want the freeze.
2) Right-click on the header and select Freeze Rows and Columns  in the context menu, or  
go to View > Freeze Rows and Columns  on the Menu bar, or click the Freeze Rows 
and Columns icon on the Standard toolbar.
To freeze both a set of rows and a set of columns  (single or multiple):
1) Click in the cell that is immediately below the rows you want to freeze and immediately to  
the right of the columns you want frozen.
2) Choose View > Freeze Rows and Columns  on the Menu bar, or click the Freeze Rows 
and Columns icon on the Standard toolbar.
Unfreezing
To unfreeze all rows and columns that are currently frozen, do one of the following:
• Right-click on any row or column header and choose Freeze Rows and Columns  in the 
context menu.
• Select View > Freeze Rows and Columns  on the Menu bar.
• Click the Freeze Rows and Columns  icon on the Standard toolbar.
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 115The heavy lines that indicate frozen rows and columns will disappear.
Splitting the screen
Calc allows you to view different areas of a sheet simultaneously by splitting the screen into 
separate sections. Each section provides you with a view of one part of the sheet. This feature is  
also known as “splitting the window.” The screen can be split horizontally, vertically, or both at 
once (which would give you up to four sections of the sheet in view at one time). Figure 72 
provides an example of a sheet split horizontally into two sections, with the split indicated by the 
gray separator line located between rows 2 and 7.
This feature is especially useful when a large spreadsheet has one cell containing data that is 
used by three formulas in different cells. When you the split the screen, you can position the cell 
containing the number in one section of the view and the cells with formulas in other sections. 
This makes it easy to see how changing the number in one cell affects each of the formulas.
Figure 72: Split screen example
Splitting horizontally or vertically
There are two methods to split a screen either horizontally or vertically. In these cases, you can 
scroll through each section independently of the other. A horizontal or vertical separator line 
appears indicating where the split has been placed.
Method 1
• To split horizontally, you can right-click on the row header below the row where you want 
to split and select Split Window in the context menu. Alternatively you can left-click on 
the row header below the row where you want to split and then go to View > Split 
Window on the Menu bar or click the Split Window icon on the Standard toolbar.
• To split vertically, you can right-click on the column header to the right of the column 
where you want to split and select Split Window in the context menu. Alternatively you 
can left-click on the column header to the right of the column where you want to split and 
then go to View > Split Window  on the Menu bar or click the Split Window icon on the 
Standard toolbar.
Method 2
• To split horizontally, click on the horizontal split bar at the top of the vertical scroll bar 
(Figure 73 – left) and drag it down to a position below the row where you want the 
horizontal split.
• To split vertically, click on the vertical split bar at the right of the horizontal scroll bar 
(Figure 73 – right) and drag it left to a position to the right of the column where you want 
the vertical split.
116 |Getting Started 24.8Splitting horizontally and vertically
There are two methods to split a screen both horizontally and vertically at the same time. 
Horizontal and vertical separator lines appear indicating where the split has been placed.
Method 1
• Click in the cell that is below the row and to the right of the column where you want to 
split. Go to View > Split Window  on the Menu bar or click the Split Window icon on the 
Standard toolbar.
Method 2
• Click on the horizontal split bar at the top of the vertical scroll bar (Figure 73 – left) and 
drag it down to a position below the row where you want the horizontal split. Then, click 
on the vertical split bar to the right of the horizontal scroll bar (Figure 73 – right) and drag 
it left to a position to the right of the column where you want the vertical split.
Figure 73: Split screen bars
Removing split views
To remove a split view, do one of the following:
• Double-click on each split line.
• Click and drag the split lines back to their default positions at the ends of the scroll bars.
• Go to View on the Menu bar and deselect Split Window.
• Right-click on a column or row heading and deselect Split Window in the context menu.
• Click the Split Window icon on the Standard toolbar.
Entering data using the keyboard
Most data entry in Calc is done with the keyboard.
Numbers
Click in the cell and type the number using the number keys on either the main keyboard or the 
numeric keypad. By default, Calc right-aligns the numbers in a cell.
Negative numbers
To enter a negative number, either type a minus (–) sign in front of the number or enclose the 
number in parentheses (1234). The negative number will be displayed as follows: –1234.
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 117Leading zeroes
If a number is entered with leading zeroes (for example, 01481), Calc will drop the leading 
zeroes by default. To retain a minimum number of characters in a cell when entering numbers 
and retain the number format, for example 1234 and 0012, use one of two methods to add 
leading zeroes:
Method 1
1) Select the cell that will retain leading zeroes, then access the Format Cells dialog (Figure  
74) by doing one of the following:
• Right-click on the selected cell then choose Format Cells in the context menu.
• Go to Format > Cells on the Menu bar.
• Press Ctrl+1.
2) Select the Numbers tab and select Number in the Category list.
3) In the Options area, set the Leading zeroes field to the maximum number of zeroes to 
display in front of the integer part of the number. If you want to display numbers with four 
integer digits, enter the value 4. Then any number containing less than four integer digits 
will have leading zeroes added – for example 12 is displayed as 0012.
Figure 74: Format Cells dialog – Numbers tab
4) Click OK. The number in the selected cell retains its number format and any formula 
used in the spreadsheet will treat the entry as a number in formula functions.
Method 2
1) Select the cell.
2) On the Sidebar, go to the Properties deck.
118 |Getting Started 24.83) On the Number Format panel (Figure 75), select Number in the drop-down list, and enter  
the maximum number of zeroes to display in front of the integer part of a number in the 
Leading zeroes box. Formatting is applied immediately.
Figure 75: Set leading zeroes in Sidebar
Tip
To format numbers with decimal places and prevent a leading zero (for example, 
“.019” instead of “0.019”), go to the Format code box on the Numbers tab of the 
Format Cells dialog and then type a period or full stop and add one or more question  
marks (“?”). Each question mark represents a decimal place. For example, for 3 
decimal places, type one period and three question marks [ .???] and click OK. Any 
number with only decimal places will then have no leading zero.
Tip
If a numeric value does not need to be treated as a number in calculations (for 
example when entering a zip code), you can type an apostrophe (') before the 
number, for example “ '01481”. When you move the cell focus, the apostrophe is 
hidden, any leading zeroes are retained, and the number is converted to left-aligned 
text.
Numbers as text
Numbers can also be entered as text using one of the following methods:
Method 1
1) Select the cell which contains the number, then access the Format Cells dialog (Figure  
74).
2) Make sure the Numbers tab is selected, then select Text in the Category list.
3) Click OK. The number is converted to text and, by default, left-aligned.
Method 2
1) Select the cell.
2) On the Sidebar, go to the Properties deck.
3) On the Number Format panel (Figure 75), select Text in the drop-down list. Formatting is  
applied to the cell immediately.
Note
You can change how Calc converts strings to numeric values, cell references, dates, 
and times by going to Tools > Options > LibreOffice Calc > Formula . In the 
Detailed Calculation Settings  area, select Custom (conversion of text to numbers 
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 119and more). Click the Details button, and then select the proper treatment in the 
Detailed Calculation Settings dialog. See the system help for more information.
Text
To enter text in a cell, click in the cell and type. By default, text is left-aligned in a cell. Cells can 
contain several lines of text. If you want to use paragraphs, press Ctrl+Enter to create another 
paragraph.
If you are entering several lines of text, extend the Input line by clicking on the Expand Formula 
Bar icon, which is located on the right-hand end of the Formula bar, and then the Input line 
becomes multi-line. Click the icon again to return the Input line to its single line height.
Date and time
Select the cell and type the date or time. You can separate the date elements with a slash (/) or 
a hyphen (–), or use text, for example 10 Oct 2020. The date format automatically changes to 
the selected format used by Calc.
Note
Tools > Options > Languages and Locales > General > Formats > Date 
acceptance patterns  defines the date patterns that will be recognized by Calc. In 
addition, every locale accepts input in an ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD pattern (for 
example, 2020-07-26).
When entering a time, separate time elements with colons (for example, 10:43:45) and the time 
format automatically changes to the selected format used by Calc.
To change the date or time format used by Calc:
1) With the cell selected, open the Format Cells dialog (Figure 74).
2) Make sure the Numbers tab is selected, then select Date or Time in the Category list.
3) Select the date or time format you want to use in the Format list.
4) Click OK.
Cell fields
If you wish to insert a date, the sheet name, or the document name in a cell as a field, do the 
following:
1) Select a cell and double-click to activate edit mode.
2) Right-click and select Insert Field > Date , Sheet Name, or Document Title in the 
context menu. The Insert Field sub-menu contains two Date options – use the 
occurrence located directly above the Sheet Name item. Alternatively you can go to 
Insert > Field > Date , Sheet Name, or Document Title on the Menu bar.
3) The fields are updated with the latest information when the spreadsheet is saved or 
recalculated using the Ctrl+Shift+F9 shortcut or going to Data > Calculate > 
Recalculate Hard on the Menu bar.
Note
The other Insert Field > Date  option and its associated Time option in the context 
menu insert the current date and time respectively. However, unlike the commands 
described above, these values are not inserted as fields and will not be updated or 
120 |Getting Started 24.8recalculated later. Similarly, the Insert > Date and Insert > Time options on the 
Menu bar do not insert values as fields.
Note
The Document Title commands insert the name of the spreadsheet. They do not 
insert the title defined on the Description tab of the Properties dialog for the file.
AutoCorrect Options
Calc automatically applies many changes during data input using AutoCorrect, unless you have 
deactivated any AutoCorrect changes. For more information, refer to Chapter 2, Entering and 
Editing Data, in the Calc Guide. You can also undo any AutoCorrect changes by using Edit >

Speeding up data entry
Calc provides multiple tools for removing some of the drudgery from input. The most common 
tool is to drag and drop the contents of one cell to another with a mouse. Other tools include 
AutoInput, the Fill tool, selection lists, the Data Entry tool, and the ability to input information into 
multiple sheets of the same document.
AutoInput tool
The AutoInput tool in Calc automatically completes entries, based on other entries in the same 
column. By default, AutoInput is activated in Calc. To turn it off, go to Tools on the Menu bar and  
deselect AutoInput.
When text is highlighted in a cell, AutoInput can be used as follows:
• Press Enter to accept the completion and move to the next cell. Press F2 to accept the 
completion and move the cursor to the end of the text inside the cell. Clicking outside the  
cell will accept the completion and select the clicked cell.
• When multiple matches continue with the same letters they will appear in the cell after 
what has already been typed. Press Right Arrow to accept the partial completion and 
move the cursor to the end of the text inside the cell.
• To view more completions that start with the same letters, use the key combinations 
Ctrl+Tab to scroll forward, or Ctrl+Shift+Tab to scroll backward.
• To see a list of all available AutoInput text items for the current column, use the keyboard  
combination Alt+Down Arrow.
When typing formulas using characters that match function names, a help tip will appear listing 
the available functions that start with matching characters. AutoInput ignores the case sensitivity 
of any data you enter.
Filling cells
This tool allows you to duplicate existing content or create a series across a range of cells (see 
examples in Figure 77) using one of the following methods.
Caution
When you are selecting cells to use the Fill tool, make sure that none of the cells 
contain important data, except for the cell data you want to use. When you use the 
Fill tool, any data contained in the selected target cells is overwritten.
Method 1
1) Select one or more cells that contain the contents you want to copy or start the series 
from.
2) Drag the mouse pointer to fill the cells in any direction you desire, or hold down the 
Shift key and click in the last cell you want to fill.
122 |Getting Started 24.83) Go to Sheet > Fill Cells on the Menu bar and select the direction in which you want to 
copy or create data ( Fill Down, Fill Right, Fill Up, Fill Left) or one of the other options 
(Fill Sheets, Fill Series, Fill Random Number ) in the submenu. For more information 
about the Fill Sheets and Fill Random Number  options, see Chapter 2, Entering and 
Editing Data in the Calc Guide.
Tip
Ctrl+D is an alternative to selecting Sheet > Fill Cells > Fill Down  on the Menu bar.
Method 2
1) Select one or more cells that contain the contents you want to copy or start the series 
from.
2) Move the mouse pointer over the small square in the bottom right corner of the selected 
cells. The mouse pointer will change shape.
3) Click and drag in the direction you want the cells to be filled. If the original cell contained 
a number or text from a defined sort list, then a series will be created. However, if the 
Ctrl button is pressed while dragging, then the original data is copied instead. If the 
original cell contained any other text, then that text will automatically be copied.
Figure 77: Using the Fill tool
Using a fill series
When you select a series fill from Sheet > Fill Cells > Fill Series  on the Menu bar, the Fill 
Series dialog (Figure 78) opens. Here you can select the type of series you want. For more 
detail about this dialog, see Chapter 2, Entering and Editing Data in the Calc Guide.
Figure 78: Fill Series dialog
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 123Defining a fill series
When a fill is initiated and the selected cell contains text, Calc will check if one of your 
predefined sort lists contains that text. If there is a sort list containing the text, Calc uses the 
entries in that sort list to fill cells. Go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice Calc > Sort Lists  to 
view your currently defined sort lists.
To define your own sort list, which can later be used as a fill series:
1) Go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice Calc > Sort Lists  to open the Sort Lists dialog 
(Figure 79). This dialog shows any previously-defined series in the Lists box and the 
contents of the highlighted list in the Entries box.
2) Click New and the Entries box is cleared.
3) Type the series for the new list in the Entries box (one entry per line).
4) Click Add and the new list will appear in the Lists box.
5) Click OK to save the new list.
Filling text cells with selection lists
Selection lists are limited to using only text that has already been entered in the same column.
1) Select a blank cell in a column that contains cells with text entries.
2) Right-click and select Selection Lists in the context menu, or press Alt+Down Arrow. A 
context menu appears listing any cell in the same column that either has at least one text  
character or whose format is defined as text.
3) Click on the text entry you require and it is entered into the selected cell.
Figure 79: Sort Lists dialog
124 |Getting Started 24.8Data Entry Form tool
This tool makes table data entry easier in spreadsheets, accelerating intensive manual input. 
Using the tool you can enter, edit, and delete data records (or rows) and avoid horizontal 
scrolling when the table has many columns or when some columns are very wide.
To be effective, the data table should have a header row, where the content of each cell is the 
title of the column. The content of each header cell becomes the label for each data field in the 
form.
To use the Data Entry Form tool:
1) Select a header or data cell within the table of data.
2) Go to Data > Form on the Menu bar.
3) Calc displays the Data Form dialog (Figure 80), showing the data for the first entry in the 
data table.
4) Add, edit, or remove entries from the data table as required.
5) Click the Close button to close the dialog.
Figure 80: Data Form dialog
Sharing content between sheets
You might want to share the same information in the same cell on multiple sheets (for example, 
to set up standard listings for a group of individuals or organizations). Instead of entering the list 
on each sheet individually, you can enter the information in several sheets at the same time.
1) Select the individual sheets where you want the information to be repeated. See the 
section “Selecting sheets” above for more details.
2) Enter the information in the cells on the first sheet where you want it to appear and it will 
be repeated in all the selected sheets.
Caution
This technique automatically overwrites, without any warning, any information that is 
already in the cells on the selected sheets. Make sure you deselect the additional 
sheets when you are finished entering information that is going to be repeated before  
continuing to enter data into the spreadsheet.
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 125Validating cell contents
When creating a spreadsheet, you may want to restrict users to entering data that is valid and 
appropriate for the cell. Fill tools and selection lists can handle some types of data, but are 
limited to predefined information. 
To add data validation to a cell, select that cell and use Data > Validity on the Menu bar to 
define which types of content can be entered in the cell. The Validity tool can:
• Define the range of contents that can be entered.
• Provide help messages explaining the content rules set up for the cell.
• Determine what happens if a user enters invalid content. You can set the cell to refuse 
invalid content, accept it with a warning, or start a macro when an error is entered.
See Chapter 2, Entering and Editing Data, in the Calc Guide for more information.
Editing data
Calc has multiple tools for data editing, including the ability to delete data, replace data, and 
change data.

replace the old, but cell formatting will be retained.
Alternatively, select the cell and click in the Input line on the Formula bar (Figure 52), then 
double-click on the data to highlight it completely and type the new data.
Changing data
Calc can allow you to edit the contents of a cell without removing all of the data from the cell. For  
example, changing the phrase “Sales in Qtr. 2” to “Sales rose in Qtr” can be done as follows.
Using the keyboard
1) Click in the cell to select it.
2) Press F2 to switch the cell to edit mode. The cursor is placed at the end of the content in 
the cell.
3) Use the keyboard arrow keys to position the cursor where you want to start entering the 
new data in the cell, then press the Delete key or Backspace key to delete any 
unwanted data before typing the new data.
4) When you have finished editing, press the Enter key to save the changes.
Tip
You may want to enable Tools > Options > LibreOffice Calc > General > Press 
Enter to switch to edit mode . Then, when you press the Enter key in a selected 
cell, the cell switches to edit mode, eliminating the need to press F2.

Calc comes with a predefined set of formatting themes (set of styles) that can be applied to 
spreadsheets. You cannot add new themes to Calc, but you can modify a theme’s styles after 
the theme is applied to the spreadsheet. All modified styles are only available for use in that 
spreadsheet.
To apply a theme to a spreadsheet:
1) Go to Format > Spreadsheet Theme  on the Menu bar or click the Spreadsheet Theme  
icon on the Tools toolbar to open the Theme Selection dialog (Figure 87).
2) Select the theme that you want to apply. The theme styles are immediately visible on the 
underlying spreadsheet.
3) Click OK.
Figure 87: Theme Selection dialog
Selecting a spreadsheet theme adds several new cell styles to the spreadsheet and modifies the  
Default cell style. 
If you wish, you can now open the Styles deck on the Sidebar to modify specific styles. These 
changes do not modify the theme; they only change the appearance of the style in the specific 
spreadsheet you are using. For more about modifying styles, see Chapter 4, Working with 
Styles, Templates, and Hyperlinks.
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 135Caution
Applying a new theme over an existing one will override all existing theme styles 
customization with the new theme styles.
Document themes
Document themes collect various format selections into a set that can be applied and changed 
quickly. Theme colors were implemented in LibreOffice 7.6; font and format settings are planned 
for later releases.
Calc supplies several sets of theme colors, and you can define other sets. Theme colors have 
names like Dark 1, Light 2, Accent 3, and so on. They can be used in styles or applied manually.
To set up a spreadsheet to use themes, choose colors for fonts, backgrounds, or objects from 
the Theme colors palette (Figure 88), not an ordinary color palette. The first row of the palette 
contains the theme colors, with other rows containing modifications. For example, the top-left 
color in the palette is the currently selected theme’s Dark 1 color; the leftmost color in the second  
row is a 50% lighter version of Dark 1; the entry at the intersection of the second column and 
third row is a 15% darker version of Light 1; and so on. You can hover the pointer over any 
palette cell to see a tooltip indicating the detail of that color.
Figure 88: A palette of theme colors
To change the set of theme colors, choose Format > Theme on the Menu bar and select a 
different theme on the Theme dialog (Figure 89). Colors defined as theme colors change in the 
document. You need not change any style and need not change any object individually.
Figure 89: Theme dialog
For more information, see Chapter 5, Using Styles and Templates, in the Calc Guide.
136 |Getting Started 24.8Using conditional formatting
Calc can change cell formats depending on user-specified conditions, and those conditions can 
be imposed in a specified order. For example, a table can show all the values above a specific 
average in green and all those below that average in red. Conditional formatting also allows you 
to add graphic icons and data bars to the cell background.
Conditional formatting depends upon the use of styles, and the AutoCalculate feature ( Data > 
Calculate > AutoCalculate ) must be enabled. See Chapter 4, Formatting Data, in the Calc 
Guide for details.
Filtering data
A filter is a tool that hides or displays records within a sheet based on a set of filtering conditions.  
Similar to sorting, filters are useful for narrowing down long lists of data in order to find particular 
data items. In Calc, three types of filter exist:
AutoFilter – the most straightforward filter type, providing access to a combo box through 
arrowhead buttons located at the top of one or more data columns. This box provides options for  
basic sorting (ascending and descending); sorting by background or font color; filtering by 
background or font color; filtering by condition (empty, not empty, top 10, and bottom 10); and 
others.
Standard filter – more complex than AutoFilters, allowing for up to eight filter conditions. 
Powerful filters can be set up using regular expressions. Also, unlike AutoFilters, standard filters 
use a dialog to define the conditions.
Advanced filter – filter conditions are stored in a sheet rather than entered into a dialog.
Setting up and using filters are explained in Chapter 2, Entering and Editing Data, in the Calc 
Guide.
Cell protection
Cells can be password-protected to prevent unauthorized users from making changes. Protected  
cells can optionally be hidden. Use the Cell Protection tab of the Format Cells dialog (Figure 90) 
to set up cell protection and toggle the hidden status of protected cells.
Figure 90: Cell Protection tab in Format Cells dialog
Once all desired cells have been flagged with either a protected or unprotected status:
1) Go to Tools > Protect Sheet , or right-click on the sheet’s tab and select Protect Sheet 
in the context menu. The Protect Sheet dialog opens (Figure 91).
2) Select Protect this sheet and the contents of protected cells .
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 1373) Type a password and then confirm the password. The dialog provides a password 
strength meter to indicate the strength of the entered password. This incorporates a 
colored bar to reflect password strength, with red indicating a weak password and green 
indicating a strong password. In addition, the longer the colored bar, the greater the 
strength of the password.
4) Select or deselect the elements to protect from user actions.
5) Click OK.
Figure 91: Protect Sheet dialog with password strength meter
Any cells that had been marked as protected will no longer be editable by anyone that does not 
have the password.
The protected sheet has a padlock icon in its tab, as shown in Figure 92.
Figure 92: The padlock icon in a protected sheet
Alternatively, the entire spreadsheet can be password-protected by selecting Tools > Protect 
Spreadsheet Structure  on the Menu bar. When this option is chosen, unauthorized users 
cannot add, delete, move, or rename any sheets in the document. 
Sorting records
When Calc sorts cells in a sheet, they are re-ordered based on user-specified sort criteria. Sorts 
are useful when you are searching for a particular item and become even more useful after you 
have filtered data.
Also, sorting allows you to add new information to the bottom of your spreadsheet and then use 
a sort to put the values in their proper order. When a spreadsheet is long, it is usually easier to 
add new information at the bottom of the sheet, rather than adding rows in their correct place. 
After you have added information, you can then sort the records to update the spreadsheet.
For more information on sorting records and the sorting options available, see Chapter 2, 
Entering and Editing Data, in the Calc Guide.
138 |Getting Started 24.8To use the Sort dialog on cells in a spreadsheet:
1) Select the cells to be sorted.
2) Go to Data > Sort on the Menu bar, or click the Sort icon on the Standard toolbar, to 
open the Sort dialog (Figure 93).
3) On the Sort Criteria tab, select the sort criteria in the drop-down lists. The selected lists 
are populated from the selected cells.
4) Select either ascending order (A-Z, 0-9) or descending order (Z-A, 9-0).
5) Adjust the settings as required on the Sort Criteria and Options tabs. For details, see the 
Help or Chapter 2, Entering and Editing Data, in the Calc Guide.
6) Click OK and the sort is carried out on the spreadsheet.
Figure 93: Sort dialog, Sort Criteria tab
Cell comments
Users can add a comment to a cell. These comments are small notes and text that provide extra 
information about the spreadsheet. They are not considered a part of the spreadsheet for 
calculation or printing purposes, and usually only appear when the user hovers the mouse over 
the particular cell that has been commented.
You can insert a comment by any of the following actions:
• Right-clicking on the desired cell and selecting Insert Comment in the context menu.
• Selecting Insert > Comment  on the Menu bar.
• Pressing Ctrl+Alt+C.
• Clicking the Insert Comment icon on the Standard toolbar.
Cells that contain comments are marked with a colored triangle in the upper right corner. By 
default, comments will remain hidden and only appear when you hover the mouse over a cell 
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 139that contains a comment. To toggle the visibility of comments, select View > Comments  on the 
Menu bar.
For more information, see Chapter 12, Sharing and Reviewing Spreadsheets, in the Calc Guide.
Using formulas and functions
You may need more than numbers and text in a spreadsheet. Often the contents of one cell 
depend on the contents of other cells. Formulas are equations that use numbers and variables 
to produce a result. Any cell can contain a formula. Variables are placed in cells to hold data 
required by equations.
A function is a predefined calculation entered in a cell to help you analyze or manipulate data. All  
you have to do is enter the arguments and the calculation is made automatically. Functions help 
you create the formulas required to get the results that you are looking for.
Creating formulas
Functions and formulas can be entered directly into the Formula bar or by using the Function 
Wizard. To launch the Function Wizard, click the Function Wizard icon on the Formula bar, 
select Insert > Function on the Menu bar, or press Ctrl+F2.
Inside the Function Wizard, you can choose from the many built-in Calc functions available. 
When you search for a term in the Function Wizard, function descriptions are provided as well as  
their names. You can also choose to complete functions from within the wizard rather than 
having to type full formulas into the Formula bar.
Each function, when selected, will display a brief explanation of its use and acceptable syntax. It 
will also allow you to enter the information required by that function and a result window will 
showing the expected calculation from the data entered.
Note
A fast alternative to the Function Wizard is the Functions deck on the Sidebar, where  
you can quickly list and narrow down functions. It provides brief explanations on their  
use and syntax, but does not provide the search or data entry capabilities of the full 
wizard.
Calc offers powerful built-in functions under multiple categories, covering Database, Date & 
Time, Financial, Information, Logical, Mathematical, Array, Statistical, Spreadsheet, Text, and 
Add-in functions.
For a more in-depth introduction to formulas and the Function Wizard, see Chapter 8, Using 
Formulas and Functions, in the Calc Guide.

Analyzing data
Calc includes many tools to help you analyze information, including features for copying and 
reusing data, for automatically creating subtotals, and other ways to vary information and help 
you find the answers you need. These tools are divided between the Tools and Data menus.
Calc also includes many tools for statistical analysis, and they can help you obtain important 
numerical information on data obtained from physical measurements, polls, or even business 
transactions such as sales, stock quotations, and so on. These statistical data analyses are 
available in the menu Data > Statistics.
See Chapter 10, Data Analysis, in the Calc Guide for more information on the these tools.
Pivot tables and pivot charts
One of the most useful tools for analyzing data is the pivot table, which allows you to organize, 
manipulate, and summarize large amounts of data to make it much easier to read and 
understand. They also allow you to answer different questions about a spreadsheet by 
rearranging – or pivoting – the data in it, which includes the ability to view different summaries of 
the source data, display the details of areas of interest, and create reports. You can also create a  
pivot chart that allows you to view a graphical representation of the data in a pivot table.
For example, you might have a spreadsheet containing a list of donations to various charities by 
a group of recruiters in various months, but you are only interested in how much money each 
recruiter has collected in total. Instead of manually calculating that amount by using the sorting 
and formatting options, you could arrange a pivot table which makes that data easier to organize  
and read.
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 141To create a pivot table, choose Data > Pivot Table > Insert or Edit  on the Menu bar, or click the  
Insert or Edit Pivot Table  icon on the Standard toolbar. The Pivot Table Layout dialog will 
intelligently guess the column headings from the provided raw data and insert them into the 
Available Fields selection box. From there, you can drag and drop your desired information into 
column, row, data, or filter fields to organize accordingly and click OK to view the results.
To choose new information to display, or to alter the layout of the existing information, right-click 
anywhere in the existing pivot table to bring up the context menu and choose Properties. You 
can also access the same dialog by selecting Data > Pivot Table > Insert or Edit  on the Menu 
bar, or clicking the Insert or Edit Pivot Table  icon on the Standard toolbar.
For an in-depth explanation of pivot tables and the preconditions necessary to use them, see 
Chapter 9, Using Pivot Tables, in the Calc Guide.
Pivot charts
To get a quick visual representation of the data contained in a pivot table, you can generate a 
pivot chart. Functionally, pivot charts are nearly identical to regular charts except in two key 
areas. First, as the data in the pivot table is altered, the pivot chart will adjust itself automatically. 
Second, a pivot chart includes field buttons, which are graphical elements that allow you to filter 
the content of the pivot table from within its pivot chart.
For more information on pivot charts and charts in general, see Chapter 3, Creating Charts and 
Graphs, and Chapter 9, Using Pivot Tables, in the Calc Guide.
Printing
Printing from Calc is similar to  printing from other LibreOffice components (see Chapter 1, 
LibreOffice Basics), but some details of printing in Calc are different, especially regarding 
preparation for printing.
After print ranges have been defined, they are formatted with automatic page breaks. To view 
the page breaks, go to View > Page Break  on the Menu bar.
Print ranges
Print ranges can be used to print a specific part of the data and print selected rows or columns 
on every page. For more information about using print ranges, see Chapter 7, Printing, 
Exporting, Emailing, and Signing in the Calc Guide.
Defining a print range
To define a new print range or modify an existing print range:
1) Select the range of cells to be included in the print range.
2) Go to Format > Print Ranges > Define  on the Menu bar. Automatic page break lines are  
displayed on screen.
3) To check the print range, go to File > Print Preview  on the Menu bar, press 
Ctrl+Shift+O, or click the Toggle Print Preview  icon on the Standard toolbar. Calc will 
display only the cells in the print range.
Adding to a print range
After defining a print range, you can add more cells to it by creating another print range. This 
allows multiple, separate areas of the same sheet to be printed while not printing the whole 
sheet.
1) After defining a print range, select an extra range of cells for adding to the print range.
142 |Getting Started 24.82) Go to Format > Print Ranges > Add  on the Menu bar to add the extra cells to the print 
range. The page break lines are no longer displayed on the screen.
3) To check the print ranges, go to File > Print Preview  on the Menu bar, press 
Ctrl+Shift+O, or click the Toggle Print Preview  icon on the Standard toolbar. Calc will 
display the print ranges as separate pages.
Note
The additional print range will print as a separate page, even if both ranges are on 
the same sheet.
Removing a print range
It may become necessary to remove a defined print range, for example, if the whole sheet needs  
to be printed later.
To remove all the defined print ranges, go to Format > Print Ranges > Clear  on the Menu bar. 
After the print ranges have been removed, the default page break lines will appear on the 
screen.
Editing a print range
At any time, you can directly edit the print range, for example to remove or resize part of the print  
range. Go to Format > Print Ranges > Edit  on the Menu bar to open the Edit Print Ranges 
dialog where you can modify the print range.
Printing options
To select the options for page order, elements to be printed, and scale to be used when printing 
a spreadsheet:
1) Go to Format > Page Style  on the Menu bar to open the Page Style dialog (Figure 95).
2) Select the Sheet tab and make your selections from the available options. Click OK.
Figure 95: Page Style dialog – Sheet tab
Chapter 3,  Getting Started with Calc  | 143Repeat printing of rows or columns
If a sheet is printed on multiple pages, you can set up certain rows or columns to repeat on each  
printed page. For example, if the top two rows of the sheet as well as column A need to be 
printed on all pages, do the following:
1) Go to Format > Print Ranges > Edit  on the Menu bar to open the Edit Print Ranges 
dialog (Figure 96).
2) Type the row identifiers in the Rows to Repeat box. For example, to repeat rows 1 and 2,  
type $1:$2. This automatically changes Rows to Repeat from - none - to 
- user defined -.
3) Type the column identifiers in the Columns to Repeat  box. For example, to repeat 
column A, type $A. In Columns to Repeat , - none - changes to - user defined -.
4) Click OK.
For more information on editing print ranges, see Chapter 7, Printing, Exporting, Emailing, and 
Signing, in the Calc Guide.
Figure 96: Edit Print Ranges dialog
Page breaks
While defining a print range can be a powerful tool, it may sometimes be necessary to manually 
adjust the printout using a manual page break. A page break helps to ensure that the data prints 
properly according to the page size and page orientation. You can insert a horizontal page break  
above or a vertical page break to the left of the active cell.
Inserting a break
To insert a page break:
1) Navigate to the cell where the page break is needed.
2) Go to Sheet > Insert Page Break  on the Menu bar.
3) Select Row Break to create a horizontal page break above the selected cell or select 
Column Break to create a vertical page break to the left of the selected cell.
Tip
After selecting View > Page Break , you can right-click on a cell to access a context 
menu containing Row Break and Column Break options.
144 |Getting Started 24.8Deleting a break
To remove a page break:
1) Navigate to a cell that is next to the page break you want to remove.
2) Go to Sheet > Delete Page Break  on the Menu bar.
3) Select Row Break or Column Break as needed.
Tip
Multiple manual row and column breaks can exist on the same sheet. When you 
want to remove them, you can remove each break individually, as described above. 
However, after selecting View > Page Break , you can right-click on a cell to access 
a context menu containing a Delete All Breaks option to remove them all at once.
For more information on page breaks, see Chapter 7, Printing, Exporting, Emailing, and Signing,  
in the Calc Guide.
Headers and footers
Headers and footers are text that can be printed at the top or bottom of a page when a you print 
a spreadsheet. Headers and footers are set and defined using the same method. For more 
information on setting and defining headers and footers, see Chapter 7, Printing, Exporting, 
Emailing, and Signing, in the Calc Guide.
Headers and footers are also assigned to a page style. You can define more than one page style  
for a spreadsheet and assign different page styles to different sheets within a spreadsheet. For 
more information, see Chapter 5, Using Styles and Templates, in the Calc Guide.
Setting a header or footer
To set a header or footer:
1) Select the sheet that you want to set the header or footer for.
2) Open the Page Style dialog (Figure 97) using one of the following methods:
3) Go to Format > Page Style  on the Menu bar.
4) On the Styles deck of the Sidebar, right-click the relevant page style and select Modify in 
the context menu.
5) Double-click the name of the page style on the Status Bar.
6) Select the Header or Footer tab as appropriate.
7) Select the Header on or Footer on option.
8) Select Same content on left and right pages  if you want the same header or footer to 
appear on all the printed pages.
9) Select / deselect Same content on first page  as required.
10) Set the margins, spacing, and height for the header or footer. You can also select 
AutoFit height to automatically adjust the height of the header or footer.
11) To change the appearance of the header or footer, click on More to open the Border / 
Background dialog.
12) To set the contents, for example page number, date and so on, that appear in the header  
or footer, click Edit to open the Headers (or Footers) dialog.
13) Click OK to save your changes.

Using consistent formatting in documentsIntroduction
To ensure formatting consistency in LibreOffice documents, users can control text and other 
elements by using templates, styles and direct formatting. Direct formatting is also known as 
manual formatting. Understanding how to format documents unlocks the power of LibreOffice.
Styles
A style in LibreOffice is a collection of formatting attributes that can be applied to text and  
other objects. If text or object shares a style in LibreOffice, then that text or object shares  
the chosen attributes of that style. For example, a paragraph style can include settings 
such as font type and size, indents, spacing between lines, alignment on a page, and so 
on.
All LibreOffice installations share a default set of styles that cannot be deleted, but can 
be modified to suit the user’s formatting requirements. Also, new styles can be created 
and these styles can be deleted.
Templates
A template is a document that allows users to generate new documents that has pre-
existing contents and a set of specific formatting styles, graphics, tables, objects, and so 
on. Templates are used as a basis for creating several similar documents for company 
documents, or user guides. For example, define paragraph and character styles in a 
document, then save the document as a template. Then the command New > 
Templates… can be used to create a new document with the same look and feel of that 
template.
New documents created in LibreOffice use a default template that is hard coded into 
LibreOffice. This default template can be changed to suit personal or corporate 
requirements.
When LibreOffice is installed on a computer, a number of predefined templates are also 
installed, providing a starting point for different types of documents, such as business 
letters, presentations, or drawings.
Direct (or manual) formatting
Applies formatting directly, or manually, to selected text. For example, select a word, then  
click on a tool on the Formatting toolbar, the Sidebar, or use a keyboard shortcut to 
format the text as bold or italic. However, using direct formatting can produce documents 
with a mismatch of formatting attributes.
Styles
Working with styles
A style allows you to apply a set of common formatting elements to pages, text, frames, cells, 
graphic objects, and so on. Each style has a name such as “Body Text” and “Document Title.” 
Using styles can quickly change the format, or appearance, of selected elements.
If you do not use styles and manually format paragraphs, words, tables, page layouts, and other 
elements in documents, this can increase user workload and introduce format errors into a 
document. Styles provide consistency in documents. LibreOffice recommend the use of styles to 
reduce the workload and increase the accuracy of producing good documents with ease.
Since LibreOffice styles may work differently from other office software programs, some planning  
may be needed, but that effort will save time and effort over the longer term. Also, Writer relies 
on heading styles (or other styles if specified) when compiling a table of contents.
148 |Getting Started 24.8Note
Manual formatting overrides any applied styles and once an element has been 
formatted manually, it cannot be modified by a style. To remove direct formatting, 
select the text, then right-click and select Clear Direct Formatting  from the context 
menu. Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+M (macOS ⌘+M) to clear direct 
formatting from selected text, or go to Format > Clear Direct Formatting  on the 
Menu bar.
Style categories
See Table 8 on which style categories are available for each module. For more information, see 
the specific user guide for each LibreOffice module. All the styles are defined as: 
Page styles
Controls margins, headers and footers, borders and backgrounds. In Calc, page styles 
also define the sequence for printing sheets.
Paragraph styles
Controls all the formatting elements of a paragraph, such as text alignment, tab stops, 
line spacing, and borders, and can include character formatting.
Character styles
Affects the formatting of text within a paragraph, such as the font and size of text, or 
modifies elements such as bold and italic.
Table styles
Apply predefined formats to tables and table elements in a text document.
Frame styles
Format graphic and text frames, including text wrap, borders, backgrounds, and 
columns.
List styles
Allows selection of format and positioning of numbers or bullets in lists.
Cell styles
Format cell data, such as fonts, alignment, borders, background, number formats (for 
example, currency, date, number), and cell protection.
Drawing styles
Format drawings and presentations, such as line, area, shadowing, transparency, font, 
connectors, dimensioning, and other attributes.
Presentation styles
Format font, indents, spacing, alignment, and tabs.

Templates
A template is a document that contains user-specified formatting styles, graphics, tables, 
objects, and other information. LibreOffice can use a template to generate new documents with a  
common content and a common format. For example, you can add the outline of a report and 
also define paragraph and character styles in a document, save the document as a template, 
and then use the template to create a new document with the same report outline and styles.
All documents in LibreOffice are based on templates. The software has a number of predefined 
templates that can be used to create different types of documents, including business letters, 
presentations, or drawings. Templates can be created to suit your requirements. Also, templates 
160 |Getting Started 24.8can be downloaded from the LibreOffice website using the following link: 
https://extensions.libreoffice.org .
If a blank document is created in LibreOffice, then the software uses the appropriate LibreOffice 
default template. If required, this default template can be replaced by a custom template to suit 
user requirements, see “ Setting default template ” below for more information.
Custom LibreOffice templates
User-created templates are located in the My Templates folder and the next time LibreOffice is 
started, those templates appear in the LibreOffice startup window and the Select a Template 
dialog.

Working with Images and 
Graphics
Images, Graphics, Gallery, Drawing Tools, FontworkIntroduction
Adding image and graphic files to LibreOffice documents consist of the following types:
• Image and graphic files, for example photos, drawings, PDF documents, and scanned 
images.
• Diagrams created using LibreOffice Draw.
• Artwork created using clipart or Fontwork.
• Charts created using LibreOffice Calc.
• Images, clipart and diagrams from the LibreOffice Gallery.
This chapter provides basic instructions and information for image and graphic files. For more 
detailed information and instructions on image and graphic files, see the specific user guide 
available for each LibreOffice module.
Images and graphics
Creating
Image and graphic files are created using a graphics program, scanning, or downloading from 
the Internet, or photos from a digital camera. When downloading image and graphic files from 
the Internet, make sure the licensing, or copyright, allows the use of an image or graphic.
LibreOffice can import, rotate and flip various vector (line drawing) image and graphic files. 
LibreOffice also supports raster (bitmap) file formats and the most common formats for raster 
files are GIF, JPG, PNG, and BMP. See Appendix B for a full list of image and graphic formats 
that LibreOffice can import.
LibreOffice can also import SmartArt images from Microsoft Office files. For example, Writer can 
open a Microsoft Word file that contains SmartArt and edit the SmartArt images.
Editing
To edit photos and other bitmap images, use a bitmap editor. To edit line drawings, use a vector 
drawing program. There is no need to use additional graphic applications because LibreOffice 
Draw has the capability to edit images and graphics.
Freely available Open-source tools are also a good alternative when editing image and graphic 
files, for example GIMP (bitmap editor) and Inkscape (vector drawing program). Open-source 
tools and many other Open-source applications work on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating 
systems.
Adding
Image and graphic files can be added to a document using one of the following methods:
• Inserting a file directly from a graphics program, or a scanner.
• Dragging images and graphics from a clipart gallery.
• Copying and pasting from a source on a computer.
172 |Getting Started 24.8Inserting
When an image, or graphic, file is available on the computer being used, the file is inserted into 
a LibreOffice document using one of the following methods. These insertion methods are only 
examples because actual insertion does depend on the following:
• Computer operating system.
• Computer setup.
• LibreOffice module being used.
Drag and drop
Dragging and dropping embeds a copy of the file into a document.
1) Open a file browser window and locate the file to be inserted.
2) Drag the file into the LibreOffice document and drop it on the selected page.
Note
To link an image, or graphic, file instead of embedding, hold down the Ctrl+Shift 
keys (macOS ⌘+Shift) while dragging the file.
Insert Image dialog
1) Open a LibreOffice document and click on the page where the image, or graphic, is to be  
inserted.
2) Go to Insert > Image on the Menu bar to open the Insert Image dialog (Figure  113). This 
dialog is similar to a file browser window.
Figure 113: Insert Image dialog
3) Navigate to where the file is located and select it. If the Preview option is selected in the 
Insert Image dialog, a preview of the selected image, or graphic, appears in the Preview 
box.
4) Click on Open and the image, or graphic, is embedded into the document and Insert 
Image dialog closes.
5) If the image, or graphic, is going to be linked and not embedded, select the Link option 
before clicking Open.
Chapter 5,  Working with Images and Graphics  | 173Note
If the Link option is selected, a message box appears when Open is clicked and the 
Confirm Linked Graphic dialog opens. Select Keep Link to the link the file, or 
Embed Graphic to embed the image, or graphic. To prevent this message from 
appearing again, deselect the option Ask when linking a graphic . When inserting 
the same image, or graphic, several times in a document, LibreOffice embeds only 
one copy of the file.
Copy and paste
1) Open both the source and target documents.
2) In the source document, select the image to be copied and copy the image to the 
clipboard. Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Ins (macOS +C⌘)
3) In the target document, click at the position where the image is to be placed.
4) Paste the image from the clipboard into the document. Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+V or 
Shift+Ins (macOS +V⌘)
Note
Embedding
If the source document is closed before the image is pasted into the target 
document, the image stored on the clipboard could be lost.
Embedding linked image, or graphic, files breaks the link to the file and becomes part of the 
document. Linked images, or graphics can be embedded as follows:
1) Open a document in LibreOffice and go to Edit > External Links  on the Menu bar to 
open the Edit Links dialog (Figure  114).
Figure 114: Edit Links dialog
2) Select the files that are going to be embedded.
3) Click on Break Link, then click Yes to confirm embedding the files.
174 |Getting Started 24.8Linking
When linking images, or graphics, LibreOffice creates a link to the file instead of saving a copy of  
the file in a document. The result is that the image, or graphic, is displayed in the document. 
However, when the document is saved, it contains only a reference to the linked file, not the file 
itself. The document and the image, or graphic, remain as two separate files reducing file size.
Advantage
File can be modified separately using a graphics program. The modified image, or 
graphic, appears the next time the document is opened. This is an advantage if another 
person is updating the files, for example a graphic artist.
Advantage
Linking reduces the file size of the document when it is saved, because the file itself is 
not included in the document. However, file size is usually not a problem on modern 
computers, and LibreOffice can handle large files.
Disadvantage
Sending a document with linked files to another computer, the linked files must also be 
sent, or moved with the document so that the receiver sees the linked images, or 
graphics in the document. Keep track of the file locations and make sure any recipient 
knows where to store the files so the document can find the files when it is opened. For 
example, image files placed in a subfolder named Images in the folder containing the 
document. The recipient needs to put the image files in an Images subfolder in the same 
folder the document has been placed.
Scanning
If a scanner is connected to a computer, LibreOffice can use the scanning software to scan an 
image, graphic, or document, then place the scanned media into the open document. The 
following scanning procedure is an example of how to insert scanned media into a document.
1) Go to Insert > Media > Scan > Select Source  on the Menu bar and select the scanning 
source from the list of available devices.
2) Click in the document where the scanned media is to be inserted.
3) Place the media for scanning onto the selected scanner.
4) Go to Insert > Media > Scan > Request  on the Menu bar to open the scanning 
software.
5) Click on Preview in the scanning software to scan the media and a preview image 
appears in the scanning software.
6)  Adjust settings for image quality, size, and other attributes in the scanning software.
7) Click on Scan in the scanning software and the media is scanned. A scanned copy of the  
media is inserted into the LibreOffice document.
8) Click on Close in the scanning software to close the scanning application.
Note
The scanning software must be an application that LibreOffice recognizes and is 
compatible to scan and insert media into a document.
After a scanning sources has been selected, LibreOffice remembers the selected 
scanning source. This eliminates the need to select a scanning source each time 
scanned media is inserted into a document.
Chapter 5,  Working with Images and Graphics  | 175Inserting using the Gallery
The Gallery (Figure  115) provides a convenient way to insert media, such as graphics and 
sounds, into documents. The Gallery is available in the Writer, Calc, Impress, and Draw modules  
of LibreOffice. When copied, Gallery images are embedded into a document, but can also be 
linked to the Gallery image. See “ LibreOffice Gallery ” below for more information.
Figure 115: Gallery deck in Sidebar — Icon View
1) Click on Gallery on the right side of the Sidebar, or use the keyboard shortcut 
Ctrl+Alt+3 (macOS + ⌘ ⌥+3) to open the Gallery deck.
2) Select a Gallery theme from the list provided.
3) Select the required image from the displayed images with a single click.
4) To insert the required image into the document use one of the following methods:
– Drag and drop the image into the document.
– Right-click on the image and select Insert in the context menu. This places the image 
in the center of the document.
5) To insert an image as a link, hold down the Shift and Ctrl (macOS ) keys, then drag ⌘  
and drop the object into the document.
Editing images or graphics
LibreOffice provides many tools for editing images and graphics. These tools are described in 
more detail in the relevant user guide for each LibreOffice module. Editing images, or graphics, 
consists of the following:
• Cropping, resizing, modifying, filtering, and positioning.
• Wrapping text around images.
• Using images as backgrounds and watermarks.
176 |Getting Started 24.8For complex editing, it is recommended to use a graphics application, such as Gimp, or 
Inkscape. The edited image, or graphic, can then be inserted into LibreOffice.
Image toolbar
When an image is inserted, or an image is selected in the document, the Image toolbar opens 
automatically. If the Image toolbar does not open, go to View > Toolbars on the Menu bar and 
select Image from the submenu. Two other toolbars also become available when an image is 
selected:
• Image Filter toolbar, which can be used as a floating toolbar.
• Color toolbar, which opens as a separate floating toolbar.
Using these three toolbars together, corrections and adjustments can be applied to an image. 
Also, special effects can be applied, such as transparency, color adjustment, flipping and 
rotation, and special effect filters.
Cropping
If only a part of an image, or graphic, is to be used in a document, it can be cropped. LibreOffice 
provides two ways to crop an image, or graphic:
• Crop tool — available as a tool on toolbars, or in a context menu after right -clicking on 
an image, or graphic. The Crop tool provides a quick and easy way to crop an image, or 
graphic.
• Crop page in the Writer Image dialog — accessed by right -clicking on the image, or 
graphic, and selecting Properties in the context menu. The Crop page provides more 
control when cropping.
Note
When an image, or graphic, is inserted into a LibreOffice document and is cropped, 
the image, or graphic, itself is not cropped. LibreOffice masks the parts of the image, 
or graphic, that have been cropped. If the document is exported as HTML, the 
original image, or graphic, is also exported. For exporting individual cropped images, 
or graphics, see “Exporting” on page 205.
Resizing
To fit an image, or graphic, into a LibreOffice document, it may have to be resized. The quickest 
way to resize an image, or graphic, is to use the selection handles as shown by the following 
example.
1) Click on an image, or graphic, to display the selection handles.
2) Position the cursor over one of the selection handles and the cursor changes shape, 
giving a graphical representation of the resizing direction as follows:
– Corner handles simultaneously resizes both width and height of an image.
– Horizontal handles resizes the height of an image.
– Vertical handles resizes the width of an image.
3) Click on a selection handle and drag to resize the image, or graphic. During resizing, a 
ghost image appears helping to resize an image, or graphic, (Figure  116).
4) To maintain the original height and width proportions of an image while dragging using a 
selection handle, hold down the Shift key before dragging a selection handle. 
Remember to release the Shift key before releasing the selection handle.
Chapter 5,  Working with Images and Graphics  | 177Figure 116: Example of resizing an image
Positioning
After inserting an image, or graphic, into a LibreOffice document, it may have to be repositioned 
to achieve the correct document format. The quickest way to resize an image, or graphic, is to 
use the cursor as shown by the following example.
1) Select an image, or graphic, to display the selection handles.
2) Move the cursor over a selected image, or graphic, and the cursor changes shape to a 
grabbing cursor. The grabbing shape depends on the computer setup and the computer 
operating system.
3) Click and drag the selected image, or graphic, to the desired position. During movement, 
a ghost image appears helping with repositioning (Figure  117).
4) Release the cursor when the image, or graphic, is in the desired position.
Figure 117: Example of positioning an image
Tip
The arrow keys on the keyboard can also be used to quickly move a selected image,  
or graphic, into a new position.
Rotating images
After inserting an image, or graphic, into a LibreOffice document, it can be rotated to achieve the  
correct document format. The quickest way to rotate an image, or graphic, is to use the cursor as  
shown by the following example.
1) Click on an image, or graphic, to display the selection handles.
2) Click again (NOT double -click) on the selected image, or graphic, switching on rotation 
mode, or go to Format > Rotate on the Menu bar.
178 |Getting Started 24.8Note
Using a double-click on an image, or graphic, switches on text editing mode for the 
selected image, or graphic.
3) Move the cursor over one of the corner handles and the cursor changes shape indicating  
the movement direction.
4) Click on a corner selection handle and move in the direction required to rotate the object.  
Only the corner selection handles are active for rotation.
5) When satisfied with the rotation, release the cursor.
6) To restrict the rotation angles to multiples of 15 degrees, press and hold the Shift key 
while rotating the image. This is useful for rotating images through a right angle, for 
example from portrait to landscape. Remember to release the Shift key before 
releasing the cursor.
7) To change the rotation center of the object, click and drag the central pivot point to the 
desired position before rotating. The central pivot point can be moved to any position on 
the document, even outside of the image boundaries.
Figure 118: Example of rotating an image
Flipping
After inserting an image, or graphic, into a LibreOffice document, it can be flipped either 
vertically, or horizontally. Depending on which LibreOffice module is being used, use one of the 
following methods to quickly flip an image, or graphic:
• Right-click on the selected image, or graphic, and select Flip > Vertically or 
Horizontally from the context menu.
• Click on Vertically, or Horizontally on the Line and Filling toolbar.
• Click on Flip Vertically, or Flip Horizontally on the Image toolbar.
• Go to Format > Flip > Vertically,  or Horizontally on the Menu bar.
• Go to Format > Rotate or Flip > Flip Vertically,  or Flip Horizontally on the Menu bar
• Click on Flip Vertically, or Flip Horizontally in the Position and Size  panel on the 
Properties deck of the Sidebar.
Arranging
LibreOffice organizes images and graphics in a stack. The image, or graphic, on the top level of 
a stack covers the images and graphics on the lower levels, if any overlapping occurs. Select 
images, or graphics, and use one of the following methods to change the stack level:
• Click on the required arrange tool on the Line and Filling toolbar.
Chapter 5,  Working with Images and Graphics  | 179• Right-click on selected objects and select Arrange from the context menu, then select 
the required arrange option from the sub-context menu.
• Go to Format > Arrange  on the Menu bar and select an option from the submenu.
• Use the keyboard shortcut available for each arrangement option.
The stack level of each image, or graphic, can be changed. The options available for arranging 
the stack level of images, or graphics are as follows:
Bring to Front
Selected object is moved in front of all other objects. Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift++ 
(macOS ⌘+Shift++).
Bring Forward
Selected object is moved one level up in the stack. Keyboard shortcut Ctrl++ (macOS 
⌘++).
Send Backward
Selected object is moved one level down in the stack. Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+– 
(macOS ⌘+–).
Send to Back
Selected object is moved behind all other objects. Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+– 
(macOS ⌘+Shift+–).
In Front of Object
Moves the first selected object in front of the second selected object. Select the first 
object, then click on the second object and the objects swap position.
Behind Object
Moves the first selected object behind the second selected object. Select the first object, 
then click on the second object and the objects swap position.
Reverse
Swaps the stacking order of two selected objects.
Alignment and positioning
When an image, or graphic, is added to a document, the alignment and positioning has to be 
selected in respect to text and other objects on a document page.
Arrangement
Is the positioning of an image, or graphic, on an imaginary vertical axis. Arrangement 
controls how images, or graphics are stacked upon each other, or relative to the text.
Alignment
is the vertical, or horizontal positioning of an image, or graphic, in relation to the selected 
anchor point.
Anchoring
Is a reference point for that an image, or graphic, is fixed in a document. This reference, 
or anchor point can be a page, frame, cell, paragraph, or character. An image, or graphic,  
always has an anchor point.
Text wrapping
In a document refers to the relation of images and graphics to the surrounding text. 
Options for text wrapping allow the text to wrap around an image, or graphic, as follows:
– One or both sides of the image, or graphic.
180 |Getting Started 24.8– Above or below of the image, or graphic.
– Allow text overprint of the image, or graphic.
– Allow of the image, or graphic, to cover the text.
– Treat the image, or graphic, as a separate paragraph, or character.
Exporting
To use another graphics application to edit an image, or graphic, the file is exported directly from  
the document. The following procedure is an example only. Actual procedure depends on the 
computer operating system and computer setup.
1) Right-click on the image, or graphic.
2) Select Save from the context menu to open the Image Export dialog (Figure  119).
3) Navigate to the folder where the image, or graphic, is going to be exported to.
4) Enter a file name in the File name text box and select the file type from the options 
available from the drop-down list in File type.
5) Click on Save to export the file and close the dialog.
6) Open the graphics program, then navigate to the folder where the file is located.
7) Carry out the necessary editing to the file and save the file in the required format. The 
image, or graphic, can then be re-inserted back into the document.
Figure 119: Image Export dialog
Compressing
If an image, or graphic, has a large file size, it can be compressed to reduce the file size. This 
results in a smaller file size for the document, but may result in a loss of quality when the image, 
or graphic, is compressed. The following procedure is an example only. Actual procedure 
depends on the computer operating system and computer setup.
1) Right-click on the image, or graphic.
2) Select Compress from the context menu to open the Compress Image dialog 
(Figure 120).
3) Use options available in Compression and Resolution to compress the image, or 
graphic.

this location.
Note
The location of Gallery themes installed using LibreOffice extensions are determined 
by the extension settings.
Chapter 5,  Working with Images and Graphics  | 185Creating image maps
An image map defines areas of an image (called hotspots) with hyperlinks to web addresses, 
other files on the computer, or parts of the same document. Hotspots are the graphic equivalent 
of text hyperlinks (for more information, see Chapter 4, Working with Styles, Templates, and 
Hyperlinks).
Clicking on a hotspot causes LibreOffice to open the linked page in the appropriate program (for 
example, the default browser for an HTML page; LibreOffice Calc for an ODS file; a PDF viewer 
for a PDF). Hotspots can be in various shapes and several hotspots can be included on the 
same image.
Image map editor
1) In a LibreOffice document, select the image where hotspots are going to be defined.
2) Go to Tools > ImageMap  on the Menu bar to open the ImageMap Editor dialog 
(Figure 124). The main part of the dialog displays the image where hotspots are to be 
defined.
3) Use the tools and fields in the dialog to define the required hotspots and links. A hotspot 
is identified by a line indicating its shape. The information needed for the hotspot 
includes the address pointed to by the hyperlink and the text to be displayed when the 
cursor is moved over the hotspot.
4) Click on Apply to apply the settings.
5) Click Save to save the image map to a file, then close the dialog.

LibreOffice drawing tools
Drawing tools in LibreOffice are used to create graphics consisting of rectangles, circles, lines, 
text, and other predefined shapes. Also several graphics can be grouped to maintain their 
relative position and proportion with each other. Graphics are placed directly on a page in a 
document, or inserted into a frame.
Tip
When creating complex drawings, it is recommended to use LibreOffice Draw to 
make use of more advanced drawing features, for example drawing layers and 
styles.
Drawing toolbar
An example Drawing toolbar is shown in Figure  125. If the Drawing toolbar is not displayed, it 
can be opened by going to View > Toolbars > Drawing  on the Menu bar, or by clicking on 
Show Draw Functions  on the Standard toolbar.
The default tools available on a Drawing toolbar do vary slightly between the LibreOffice 
modules. Tools can be added to a Drawing toolbar using Visible Buttons, or customizing the 
toolbar. See Chapter 12, Configuring LibreOffice, Chapter 13, Customizing LibreOffice for more 
information, or the specific user guide for each LibreOffice module.

Chapter 5,  Working with Images and Graphics  | 189Editing drawing objects
Editing drawing objects uses the same procedures that are used for editing images and 
graphics. See “Images and graphics ” above for more information.
Grouping objects
This section gives only a brief introduction to grouping of objects. An example of grouping two 
objects together is shown in Figure  127. For more information on working with grouped objects, 
see the specific user guide for each LibreOffice module.
Figure 127: Example of grouping objects
Grouping of objects is similar to putting objects into a container. Objects within a group are 
moved together as one object and any changes made are applied globally to the objects within 
the group. A group can always be undone and the objects that make up the group can always be  
manipulated separately.
Temporary grouping
Temporary grouping is when several objects are selected together. Any changes to the objects 
are applied to all of the objects within the temporary group. For example, a temporary group of 
objects can be rotated in its entirety.
A temporary group is created using one of the following methods:
• Hold down the Shift key whilst clicking multiple objects on a slide.
• Click and drag the cursor to create a marquee around multiple objects. Release the 
cursor and all the objects within the marquee are selected.
To cancel a temporary grouping of objects, simply click outside of the selection handles 
displayed around the objects. 
Permanent grouping
1) Objects are grouped together using one of the following methods:
– Hold down the Shift key whilst clicking multiple objects on a slide.
– Click and drag the cursor to create a marquee around multiple objects. Release the 
cursor and all the objects within the marquee are selected.
190 |Getting Started 24.8– To select all the objects on the slide, go to Edit > Select All on the Menu bar, or use 
the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+A (macOS ⌘+A).
2) With selection handles displayed, use one of the following methods to create a group of 
selected objects:
– Go to Format > Group > Group  on the Menu bar.
– Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G (macOS ⌘+Shift+G).
– Right-click on an object within the selected group and select Group from the context 
menu.
Editing or formatting groups
1) Click on an object in the group to select the group. Any editing or formatting can then be 
carried out on all the objects within the group or on individual objects within the group.
2) To edit an individual object within a group, enter the group using one of the following 
methods:
– Use the keyboard shortcut F3.
– Go to Format > Group > Enter Group  on the Menu bar.
– Right-click and select Enter Group from the context menu.
3) Select individual objects within the group for editing or formatting. An example of editing 
individual objects in a group is shown in Figure  128.
4) When editing or formatting is completed, use one of the following methods to exit the 
group and the whole group then becomes selected:
– Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F3 (macOS ⌘+F3).
– Go to Format > Group > Exit Group  on the Menu bar.
– Right-click and select Exit Group from the context menu.
Figure 128: Example of editing inside a group
Ungrouping
1) Click on any one of the objects in the group to select the group.
2) With selection handles displayed, use one of the following methods to ungroup a group 
of objects:
Chapter 5,  Working with Images and Graphics  | 191– Go to Format > Group > Ungroup  on the Menu bar.
– Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+Shift+G  (macOS + ⌘ ⌥+Shift+G).
– Right-click on the group and select Ungroup from the context menu.
Fontwork
With Fontwork, graphical text art objects can be created to make a document more attractive. 
There are many different settings for text art objects (line, area, position, size, and more) giving a  
large selection of effects. Fontwork is available with the Writer, Calc, Draw, and Impress modules  
of LibreOffice, but there are small differences in the way that each module displays Fontwork.
1) Click on Insert Fontwork Text  on the Drawing toolbar, or go to Insert > Fontwork  on 
the Menu bar to open the Fontwork Gallery dialog (Figure  129).
Figure 129: Fontwork Gallery dialog
2) Select a Fontwork style from the dialog and click OK. The selected Fontwork appears 
centrally on the page and the dialog closes.
3) Double-click on the Fontwork text graphic to switch on editing mode.
4) Type in the required text to replace the default text in the Fontwork graphic and the text 
appears over the default text as shown by the example in Figure  130.
5) Press Esc key, or click outside the Fontwork graphic and the text replaces default text.
192 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 130: Example of creating Fontwork
Fontwork toolbar
The Fontwork toolbar (Figure  131) becomes visible and active when a Fontwork object is 
selected. If the toolbar is not visible, go to View > Toolbars > Fontwork  on the Menu bar. Also, 
the Fontwork panel opens in the Properties deck on the Sidebar and contains the same tools as  
the Fontwork toolbar.
Figure 131: Fontwork toolbar
Insert Fontwork Text
Opens the Fontwork Gallery dialog.
Fontwork Shape
Changes the shape of the selected object. Clicking on the triangle ▼ next to Fontwork 
Shape opens the Fontwork Shape sub-toolbar (Figure  132) allowing selection of different  
Fontwork shapes.
Figure 132: Fontwork Shape sub-toolbar
Fontwork Same Letter Heights
Changes the height of characters in the selected Fontwork object. Toggles between 
normal height where the characters have different heights to where all characters have 
the same height.
Fontwork Alignment
Specifies the text alignment within the frame. Options available are Left Align, Center, 
Right Align, Word Justify, and Stretch Justify. The effects of the text alignment can only 
be seen if the text spans over two or more lines. In the Stretch Justify mode, all lines are 
filled completely.
Chapter 5,  Working with Images and Graphics  | 193Fontwork Character Spacing
Selects the spacing between characters and whether kerning pairs are used. Options 
available are Very Tight, Tight, Normal, Loose, Very Loose, and Custom Spacing. For 
Custom Spacing, input a percentage value: 100% is normal character spacing, less than 
100% character spacing is tighter, and more than 100% character spacing is looser.
Toggle Extrusion
Converts the Fontwork object into a 3D shape using extrusion. See the Draw Guide for 
more information.
Editing Fontwork
It is possible to treat Fontwork text as an object and apply all the formatting that has been 
described in this chapter. Assign line properties only to Fontwork that does not have a 3D effect, 
otherwise the changes are not visible. Also, modify some of the Fontwork shapes by moving the 
dot that is displayed along with the selection handles. This is similar to modification of the angles  
of trapezoid and parallelogram basic shapes.
Barcodes and QR codes
Writer, Calc, Impress, and Draw can generate barcodes and QR (Quick Response) codes. 
Barcodes are used for many purposes to easily identify items using a code scanner. QR codes 
are a type of barcode containing, for example, data that points to a website or application.
Generating
1) Go to Insert > OLE Object > QR and Barcode  on the Menu bar to open the QR and 
Barcode Code dialog.

Chapter 6, 
Getting Started with Impress
Presentations in LibreOfficeWhat is Impress?
Impress is the presentation (slide show) program included in LibreOffice creating presentations 
in the Open Document Presentation (ODP) format. ODP presentations can be opened by other 
presentation software, or exported in different presentation formats.
Slides can contain many different elements, including text, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, 
charts, and a wide range of graphic objects such as clip art, drawings, and photographs. Impress  
also includes a spelling checker, a thesaurus, text styles, and background styles.
This chapter introduces some features of Impress and does not attempt to cover all of the 
features available in Impress that can be used to create presentations. See the Impress Guide 
and LibreOffice Help for more information.
To use Impress for more than very simple presentations requires some knowledge of the 
elements used on the slides. Slides containing text use styles to determine the appearance of 
that text. Creating drawings in Impress is similar to the Draw module included in LibreOffice. For 
more information, refer to Chapter 4, Working with Styles, Templates, and Hyperlinks, and 
Chapter 7, Getting Started with Draw, in this guide. It is recommended to consult the Draw 
Guide for more details on how to use the drawing tools.
Starting Impress
Start Impress using any of the methods described in Chapter 1, LibreOffice Basics. The main 
Impress window opens and, by default, the Select a Template dialog (Figure  135) displaying 
templates installed with LibreOffice.
Figure 135: Select a Template dialog
198 |Getting Started 24.8Templates included with Impress are designed to fit the two standard sizes of presentation slides  
using 4:3 and 16:9 ratios. The templates do adapt to other available sizes, which are selected by  
going to Slide > Slide Properties > Paper Format  on the Menu bar or Format in the Slide 
panel in the Properties deck on the Sidebar.
Tips
To start Impress without the Select a Template dialog, deselect Show this dialog box 
at startup in the lower left of the dialog.
In Windows or Linux, go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice Impress > General  on 
the Menu bar (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > LibreOffice Impress > 
General) and deselect Start with Template Selection  under New Document.
The Slides pane and/or Sidebar can be closed by clicking the X in the upper right 
corner of each pane, or go to View > Slide Pane  or View > Sidebar on the Menu 
bar to deselect. To reopen a pane, select View > Slide Pane  or View > Sidebar on 
the Menu bar.
Main Impress window
The main Impress window (Figure  136) has three main sections: Slides pane, Workspace, and 
Sidebar. At the top is the Menu bar and toolbars. Toolbars can be displayed, hidden, locked in 
position, or floating during the creation of a presentation.
Figure 136: Main Impress window
1) Slides pane 2) Workspace 3) Sidebar
Menu bar
The Impress Menu bar, at the top of the main window, provides several menus common to all 
LibreOffice modules. The commands may differ between each LibreOffice module for File, Edit, 
View, Insert, Format, Tools, Window, and Help. Impress has two extra menus for Slide and 
Slide Show. When a menu item is selected, a submenu opens to show commands. The Menu 
bar can be customized; see Chapter 13, Customizing LibreOffice.
Chapter 6,  Getting Started with Impress  | 199Workspace
The Workspace (normally the center of the main window) opens in Normal view. It has four 
standard views of Normal, Outline, Notes, and Slide Sorter. For more information, see 
“Workspace views” on page 235.
If master slides are used, then master views become available: Master Slide, Master Notes 
and Master Handout. There are no tabs for master views and are selected by going to View on 
the Menu bar. For more information on master slides, see the Impress Guide.
Slides pane
The Slides pane contains thumbnail images of slides in a presentation in the order in which the 
slides are shown. Clicking on a slide image in the Slides pane selects it and places the slide in 
the Workspace where changes are made to the displayed slide.
• To display or close the Slides pane, go to View > Slide Pane  on the Menu bar.
• To close the Slides pane, click on the X in the right top corner of the Slides pane.
• To display or hide the Slides pane, use the Hide/Show marker on the left of the 
Workspace.
Several additional operations can be carried out on one or more slides in the Slides pane. Also, 
these additional operations are available from a context menu when right-clicking on a slide in 
the Slides pane.
• Add new slides to a presentation.
• Hide a slide so that it will not show in a presentation.
• Delete a slide from a presentation.
• Rename a slide.
• Duplicate a slide (copy and paste).
• Move a slide to another position in the slide order by dragging and dropping it to the 
desired position.
Also, the following operations can be carried out, although there are more efficient methods than  
using the Slides pane:
• Change the slide transition following the selected slide, or after each slide in a group.
• Change the sequence of slides in the presentation.
• Change the slide design.
• Change slide layout for a group of slides simultaneously.
Sidebar
The Sidebar, normally located on the right side of the Workspace, is similar to the Sidebar in the 
other LibreOffice module and consists of eight decks. To display or hide the Sidebar, use one of 
the following methods:
1) Go to View > Sidebar on the Menu bar.
2) Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F5 (macOS ⌘+F5).
3) Use the Hide/Show marker on the right of the Workspace (Figure  136 on page 229).
4) To hide the Sidebar, click on the X in the right top corner of the Sidebar.
5) To display the Sidebar, click on one of the Sidebar icons to open a deck.
200 |Getting Started 24.8To open a Sidebar deck, use one of the following methods:
• Click on its icon on the right side of the Sidebar.
• Click on Sidebar Settings at the top of the Sidebar and select a deck from the 
drop-down list.
• Use one of the available keyboard shortcuts for Sidebar decks.
Properties
The Properties deck ( Ctrl+Alt+1, macOS + ⌘ ⌥+1) has ten panels, allowing changes to slide 
layout and formatting of slide objects.
• When a slide is selected and appears in the Workspace, the Properties deck opens with 
the Slide and Layouts panels available.
• When a slide object is selected, the panels in the Properties deck become available: 
Character, Lists, Paragraph, Area, Shadow, Line, Position and Size , Columns, 
Effect, and Image. Actual panels displayed depends on the type of object selected.
Styles
In the Styles deck ( Ctrl+Alt+2, macOS + ⌘ ⌥+2), drawing and presentation styles are applied  
to a selected object, new styles created for drawing and presentation, and formatting changes to  
both types of styles. When saving changes to a style, the changes are applied to all of the 
elements formatted with that style in the presentation. For more information on styles, see 
“Styles” on page 258 and the Impress Guide.
Gallery
Using the Gallery deck ( Ctrl+Alt+3, macOS + ⌘ ⌥+3), an object is inserted into a 
presentation either as a copy or as a link. A copied object is independent of the original object. 
Changes to the original object have no effect on the copy. A link remains dependent on the 
original object. Changes to the original object are also reflected in the linked object. See the 
Impress Guide for more information.
Navigator
The Navigator deck ( Ctrl+Alt+4, macOS + ⌘ ⌥+4) displays all objects contained in a 
presentation. It provides a convenient way to move between slides in a presentation, or select 
an object on a slide. It is recommended to give slides and objects in a presentation meaningful 
names for easy identification when using the Navigator. For more information, see “ Navigator” 
on page 234 and the Impress Guide.
Shapes
The Shapes deck ( Ctrl+Alt+5, macOS + ⌘ ⌥+5) provides panels for quick selection of basic 
shapes that are available on the Drawing toolbar: Lines and Arrows , Curves and Polygons , 
Connectors, Basic Shapes, Symbol Shapes, Block Arrows, Flowchart, Callout Shapes, 
Stars and Banners , and 3-D Objects.
Slide transition
The Slide Transition deck ( Ctrl+Alt+6, macOS + ⌘ ⌥+6) provides a selection of slide 
transitions used in a presentation. There are controls to adjust transition speed, automatic or 
manual transition, and how long a selected slide is shown (automatic transition only). For more 
information on transitions, see “ Slide transition” on page 271 and the Impress Guide.
Chapter 6,  Getting Started with Impress  | 201Animation
The Animation deck ( Ctrl+Alt+7, macOS + ⌘ ⌥+7) is used to add, change, or remove 
animations for different elements or objects on a slide and adjust how objects appear during a 
slide show. For more information on animation effects, see “ Animation effects” on page 273 and 
the Impress Guide.
Master slides
The Master Slides deck ( Ctrl+Alt+8, macOS + ⌘ ⌥+8) provides access to slide designs for 
presentations and several designs of master slides are available. The default master slide is 
blank, but the remaining master slides have backgrounds and styled text. For more information 
on master slides, see “ Working with master slides ” on page 258 and the Impress Guide.
Rulers
Rulers are positioned on the upper and left-hand sides of the Workspace. If the rulers are not 
visible, go to View > Rulers on the Menu bar. The rulers show the size of a selected object on 
the slide using double lines (highlighted in Figure  137). Rulers are also used to manage object 
handles and guide lines when positioning objects.
Figure 137: Rulers showing object size
To change the measurement units of the rulers, right-click on a ruler and select the 
measurement unit from the drop-down list, as shown in Figure  138 for the horizontal ruler. The 
horizontal and vertical rulers can be set to different measurement units.
Figure 138: Changing ruler units
202 |Getting Started 24.8The page margins in the drawing area are also represented on the rulers. The margins can be 
changed directly on the rulers by dragging them with the mouse. The margin area is indicated by  
either a grayed out area on the rulers or borders around the unused area of the ruler. This 
margin indication depends on computer setup and operating system.
Status bar
The Status bar (Figure  139), located at the bottom of the Impress window, contains information 
that maybe useful when working on a presentation. Several of the fields are the same as those 
in other modules of LibreOffice. Some Impress specific fields are described briefly below.
Figure 139: Status bar
1) Slide Number
2) Information area
3) Master slide
4) Cursor position5) Object size

Impress Guide.
Cursor position/Object size
Shows different information depending on whether objects are selected or not. When an 
object is selected, clicking in either of these areas opens the Position and Size dialog.
– When no object is selected, the position numbers show the current position (X and Y 
coordinates) of the cursor.
Chapter 6,  Getting Started with Impress  | 203– When an object is selected and resized using the cursor, the object size numbers 
show the size of the object (width and height).
– If an object is selected, the position numbers show X and Y coordinates of the object 
upper-left corner and the object size number pair displays the size of the object. These  
numbers do not relate to the object itself, but to the selection outline, which is the 
smallest possible rectangle that can contain the visible part or parts of an object.
Unsaved changes
Indicates if there are any unsaved changes in the presentation. Clicking on this icon 
saves the document. If the presentation has not been saved before, the Save As dialog 
opens giving the opportunity to save the presentation.
Digital signatures
Indicates if the presentation has a digital signature.
Text language
Indicates the language used for any text on a presentation.

percentage opens the Zoom & View Layout dialog where the settings for zoom factor and  
view layout are adjusted.
Navigator
The Navigator displays all objects contained in a presentation providing a convenient way to 
move around a presentation find items in the presentation, and reorder objects on slides.
Figure 140: Navigator dialog
204 |Getting Started 24.8To open the Navigator dialog (Figure  140) go to View > Navigator on the Menu bar, or use the 
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+F5 (macOS + ⌘Shift+F5). Alternatively, click on Navigator in 
the Sidebar to open the Navigator deck which is similar in appearance and function as the 
Navigator dialog.
The Navigator is more useful if slides and objects (pictures, spreadsheets, and so on) are given 
meaningful names, instead of leaving them with default names, for example “Slide 1” and 
“Shape 1” and so on (as shown in Figure  140). Using meaningful names allows for a slide or 
object to be easily located in a presentation.
Toolbars
Toolbars provide several tools that are used for creating slides for a presentation. To display or 
hide the various toolbars in Impress, go to View > Toolbars on the Menu bar and select the 
required toolbar in the submenu that opens. For example, the Standard and Drawing toolbars 
are displayed by default, but the Line and Filling, and Text Formatting toolbars are not shown. 
For more information on toolbars and how to use them, see Chapter 1, LibreOffice Basics, and 
the Impress Guide.
Note
The appearance of toolbar icons varies depending on the computer operating 
system, and the selection of icon size and style in Tools > Options > LibreOffice > 
View (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > Options > LibreOffice > View ).
Workspace views
The Impress workspace has four standard views selected using tabs: Normal, Outline, Notes, 
and Slide Sorter. These tabs are normally displayed the top of the Workspace (Figure  136 on 
page 229). If the tabs are not displayed, then go to View > Views Tab Bar  on the Menu bar. 
Also, different workspace views can be selected by going to View on the Menu bar and selecting  
a view in the submenu. Each of the workspace views is designed to ease the completion of 
certain tasks.
Tip
The slide notes text box can be accessed in all views using View – Notes Panel.
Master views only become available in the Workspace when Master Slide, Master Notes or 
Master Handout are selected. There are no tabs for master views and can only be selected by 
going to View on the Menu bar.
Note
Each workspace view displays a different set of toolbars when selected. To 
customize these toolbar sets, go to View > Toolbars on the Menu bar, then check or 
uncheck the toolbars to add or remove.
Normal view
Normal view is the main standard view for creating individual slides in a presentation. In Normal 
view slides are designed, text or graphics added and formatted, and any animation effects 
added to text or graphics.
To place a slide in Normal view of the Workspace, either click on the slide thumbnail in the Slide 
Pane or click on the slide name in the Navigator.
Chapter 6,  Getting Started with Impress  | 205Outline view
Outline view (Figure 141) contains all the slides of the presentation in their numbered sequence.  
It shows topic titles, bulleted lists, and numbered lists for each slide in outline format. Only the 
text contained in the default text boxes in each slide is shown. If text boxes or graphic objects 
have been added to the slides, then these objects are not displayed. Slide names are not 
included.
Figure 141: Example Outline view in Workspace
• Use Outline view for the following tasks:
– Make changes in the text of a slide:
– Add or delete text in a slide as in Normal view.
– Move a paragraph in a slide up or down by using the movement arrows on the Outline 
toolbar (Figure 142).
Figure 142: Outline toolbar
– Change the outline level of a paragraph in a slide using the left and right arrow buttons  
on the Outline toolbar.
• Compare slides with in an outline. If it is noticed in an outline that another slide is 
required, create it directly in Outline view, or return to Normal view to create it.
Notes view
Use Notes view (Figure 143) to add notes to a slide. These notes are not seen when the 
presentation is shown to an audience using an external display connected to a computer. Click 
on the words Click to add Notes and begin typing.
206 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 143: Example Notes view in Workspace
The Click to add notes text box can be resized using the resizing handles which appear when 
the edge of the notes box is selected. Move or change the size of the box by clicking and 
dragging on the box border.
When text is inserted in the Click to add notes text box, it is automatically formatted using the 
predefined Notes style in Presentation Styles  in the Styles deck on the Sidebar. The Notes 
style can be formatted to the presentation requirements. For more information on editing styles, 
see Chapter 4, Working with Styles, Templates and Hyperlinks in this guide and the Impress 
Guide.

Figure 147: Slide and Layouts panels in Properties deck on Sidebar
The first slide in a presentation is normally a title slide. The layouts Title Slide, which also 
contains a section for a subtitle, or Title Only are the most suitable layouts for the first slide in a 
presentation. For the remaining slides, select the most suitable layout to use for the slide 
contents.
Impress does not have the functionality to create custom layouts. However, the different 
elements in a slide layout can be resized and moved. For more information, see the Impress 
Guide.
Selecting slide layout
The available layouts are shown in the Layouts panel on the Properties deck on the Sidebar. 
After selecting a slide, select the slide layout using one of the following methods:

• Click on Slide > Layout on the Menu bar to open a drop-down list showing the layouts 
by name.
• Right-click on the selected slide and select Layout in the context menu to open a 
drop-down list of slide layouts.
Tip
To view the names for slide layouts, use the tooltip feature. Position the cursor on an 
icon in the Layouts panel (or on any other tool icon) in the Properties deck on the 
Sidebar and its name is displayed in a small rectangle.
210 |Getting Started 24.8Changing slide layout
Change the slide layout for a slide in a presentation as follows:
1) Select a slide in the presentation.
2) Select a new layout for the slide using one of the methods described in “ Selecting slide 
layout” above.
Slide contents
Several layouts can contain one or more content boxes, as shown by the example in Figure  148. 
Each of these content boxes can be configured to contain the following elements. For more 
information on layout content boxes, see the Impress Guide.
Figure 148: Example slide using content boxes
Slide title
Click on Click to add Title and type a title in the text box. Impress enters text editing 
mode and the Text Formatting toolbar automatically opens.
Text
Click on Click to add Text and type the contents into the text box. Impress enters text 
editing mode and the Text Formatting toolbar automatically opens.
Table
Go to Insert > Table on the Menu bar and the Insert Table dialog opens. Enter the 
number of columns and rows, then click OK. The dialog closes and a table is inserted 
into the slide. Impress enters text editing mode and the Text Formatting and Table 
toolbars automatically open.
Chart
Go to Insert > Chart on the Menu bar and the Impress default chart is inserted in the 
slide. The Chart Type panel opens in the Properties deck on the Sidebar allowing editing  
of the chart.
Image
Go to Insert > Image on the Menu bar and a file browser opens. Navigate to where the 
required image is located. Select the file and click on Open. The image is placed into the  
slide and the file browser closes. The Image panel opens in the Properties deck on the 
Sidebar allowing editing of the image file.

where the required audio or video file is located. Select the file and click on Open. The 
Chapter 6,  Getting Started with Impress  | 211audio or video file is inserted into the slide and the file browser closes. The Media 
Playback toolbar opens allowing operation of the audio or video file.
Note
Text and graphic elements can be readjusted at any time during the preparation of a 
presentation. However, changing slide layout that already has contents can have a 
dramatic effect. If the layout is changed after contents have been added, the 
contents are not lost, but they may need to be reformatted.
Modifying slide elements
When a slide is inserted into a presentation, it contains elements that were included in the 
selected slide layout. However, it is unlikely that the predefined layouts suit all requirements for a  
presentation. Elements required maybe removed, or objects inserted such as text and/or 
graphics.
Although Impress does not have the functionality to create new layouts, it allows for the resizing 
and moving of the slide elements. It is also possible to add slide elements without being limited 
to the size and position of content boxes.
Note
It is recommended that changes to slide elements in the layouts included in Impress 
are only made using Normal view, which is the default. Attempting any changes to a 
slide element when in Master view is possible, but may produce unpredictable 
results. Using Master view requires extra care as well as a certain amount of trial 
and error.
Moving contents box
1) Click on the outer frame of the contents box so that the selection handles are displayed.
2) Place the cursor on the frame so that it changes shape. This is normally a clenched 
hand, but depends on the computer setup.
3) Click and drag the contents box to its new position on the slide and release.
Resizing contents box
1) Click on the outer frame of the contents box so that the selection handles are displayed.
2) Place the cursor on the frame so that it changes shape.
3) Click and drag the selection handle on the frame to resize the contents box and release.
– Top and bottom selection handles change the height of a contents box.
– Left and right selection handles change the width of a contents box.
– Corner selection handles change width and height of a contents box.
Removing elements
1) Select a contents box, or an element to highlight it and the selection handles are 
displayed.
2) Press the Delete or Backspace key to remove the contents box or element.
212 |Getting Started 24.8Adding text
There are two ways of adding text to a slide — contents box or text box. For more information, 
see “Adding and formatting text ” on page 244 and the Impress Guide.
Contents box
Click on Click to add Text in the contents box and type the text. Outline styles are 
automatically applied to the text as it is inserted. If required, change the outline level of 
each paragraph as well as its position within the contents box by using the arrow buttons 
on the Outline toolbar and Workspace Outline view.
Text box
Click on Insert Text Box on the Standard toolbar or Drawing toolbar to select text mode, 
then click on the slide. A text box is created and the Text Formatting toolbar automatically  
opens. Type the text and click outside the text box to end text mode.
Adding images or objects
To add images or objects to a slide, for example a picture, clip art, drawing, photograph, or 
spreadsheet, click on Insert on the Menu bar and select in the drop-down menu the image or 
object type required.  See “Inserting images, tables, charts, or media ” on page 253 and the 
Impress Guide.
Modifying slide appearance
To change the background and other characteristics of all slides in the presentation, the master 
slide has to be modified or a different master slide selected, as explained in “ Working with 
master slides” on page 258.
A master slide has a specified set of characteristics that acts as a template and is used as the 
starting point for creating other slides. These characteristics include slide background, objects in 
the background, formatting of any text used, and any background graphics.
Impress has a range of master slides, which are found in the Master Slides deck on the Sidebar. 
Additional master slides can be created or and saved, or added from other sources. For more 
information on inserting, formatting, and changing a background, see the Impress Guide, or 
Draw Guide.
For example, to change the background of an individual slide or a master slide:
1) Right click on a slide, or master slide, and select Slide Properties from the context 
menu to open the Slide Properties dialog (Figure  149).
2) Select the Background tab and then select the type of background to use from None, 
Color, Gradient, Image, Pattern and Hatch.
3) Make a selection from the various properties that are available for each type of 
background.
4) Click OK to save the change and close the dialog.
Chapter 6,  Getting Started with Impress  | 213Figure 149: Slide Properties dialog — Background page
Modifying presentations
By default, a presentation displays all the slides in the same order as they appear in Slide 
Sorter view on the Workspace. Run the presentation at least once, then answer the following 
questions:
• Are the slides in the correct order? If not, some of the slides have to be moved.
• Is the information well spaced and visible to members of an audience at the back of a 
large room? The audience may not be able to see information at the bottom of a slide, so  
redesign the presentation to fit the top three-quarters of a screen.
• Would an additional slide make a particular point clearer? If so, create another slide.
• Are some of the slides unnecessary? Hide or delete the slides not required.
• Would animations help some of the slides? This is an advanced technique, but 
remember that too many animations may not create a good presentation.
• Is the slide transition the same for all sides? Varying transitions can improve a 
presentation.
Once the questions have been answered, make the necessary changes. Making changes can 
be carried out in Slide Sorter view on the Workspace. For more information on modifying and 
running a presentation, see the Impress Guide.
Adding and formatting text
Most of the slides in a presentation are likely to contain some text. This section gives some 
guidelines on how to add text and change its appearance. Text used in slides is contained in text  
boxes. For more information on adding and formatting text, see the Impress Guide.
214 |Getting Started 24.8Two types of text boxes (AutoLayout text box and text box) are available in Impress for use on 
slides. Both types of text boxes can be moved, resized, and deleted.
• Choose a predefined layout from the Layouts panel on the Properties deck on the 
Sidebar and do not select any special content type. These text boxes are called 
AutoLayout text boxes.
• Use Insert Text Box for horizontal text, or Insert Vertical Text  for vertical text on the 
Standard toolbar, Drawing toolbar, or Text toolbar (Figure  150) to create text boxes on a 
slide.
• Use the keyboard shortcut F2 to create text boxes on a slide for horizontal text .
Figure 150: Text toolbar
When adding and formatting text, the Text Formatting toolbar (Figure  151) normally opens, 
automatically providing a range of tools to add and format text.
Note
If the toolbars are not visible, go to View > Toolbars on the Menu bar and select the 
required toolbars in the drop-down list.
Figure 151: Text Formatting toolbar
Note
The area fill and borders in AutoLayout text boxes and text boxes can be edited 
using the same methods that are used for graphic objects. For more information, see  
the Impress Guide.
AutoLayout text boxes
AutoLayout text boxes are automatically created when one of the slide layouts available in 
Impress is selected.
1) Make sure Normal view is selected in the Workspace.
2) Select the slide where text is to be added into an AutoLayout text box.
3) Click on Click to add Title or Click to add text in an AutoLayout text box. The text 
automatically disappears and is replaced by a flashing text cursor. The Text Formatting 
toolbar automatically opens replacing the Line and Filling toolbar.
4) Type or paste text into the AutoLayout text box and, if necessary, format the text to the 
presentation requirements.
Chapter 6,  Getting Started with Impress  | 2155) Click outside the AutoLayout text box to deselect it.
Text boxes
1) Make sure Normal view is selected in the Workspace.
2) Select the slide where the text is to be added.
3) For horizontal text: click on the selected slide and create a text box using one of the 
following methods:
– Single line text box  — select Insert Text Box, click on the slide and then type or paste  
the text. The width of the text box increases as text is added creating a single line of 
horizontal text.
– Single line text box — use the keyboard shortcut F2, click on the slide and then type or  
paste the text. The width of the text box increases as text is added creating a single 
line of horizontal text.
– Multiple line text box — select Insert Text Box, or use the keyboard shortcut F2, click 
on the slide and drag to the approximate width required for the text box, then type or 
paste the text into the text box. The width of the text box is fixed and the height of the 
text box increases automatically as text is added creating multiple lines of horizontal 
text.
– Multiple line text box from a single line text box — use the Enter key to create a new 
paragraph, or the keyboard combination Shift+Enter to create a line break in the 
text.
4) Select the text box to switch on edit mode. This is indicated by a colored border as 
shown in by the example in Figure  152. The width and final position of the text box can 
be adjusted after adding text into the text box.
5) Click outside the text box to deselect it.
Figure 152: Example of a text box in edit mode
Vertical text
In addition to normal text boxes, where text is horizontally aligned, it is possible to insert text 
boxes where the text is vertically aligned. Vertical text is available only when Asian languages 
are selected in Tools > Options > Language Settings > Languages  (macOS LibreOffice > 
Preferences > Language Settings > Languages ).
Creating vertical text boxes is similar to creating horizontal text boxes. Use the Insert Vertical 
Text tool on the Standard, Drawing, or Text toolbars to create a vertical text box with single or 
multiple lines of text. See “ Text boxes” on page 246 on how to create a text box for single or 
multiple lines of text.
Quick font resizing
To quickly increase or decrease the font size of selected text by using the tools Increase Font 
Size (Ctrl+]) (macOS +⌘]) and Decrease Font Size  (Ctrl+[) (macOS + ⌘[) on the Text 
216 |Getting Started 24.8Formatting toolbar. The amount by which the font size changes depends on the standard sizes 
available for the font in use.
Note
AutoLayout text boxes automatically adjust font size of any text inserted into the box.  
For example, if a long piece of text is inserted into an AutoLayout text box, the font 
size may decrease in size to fit into the box.
Pasting text
Text can be added to an AutoLayout, or normal text box, by copying it from another document 
and pasting it into Impress. The formatting of pasted text will probably not match the formatting 
of the surrounding text, or that of the other slides in the presentation. This maybe what is 
required on some occasions. However, to make sure that the presentation style is consistent and  
does not become a patchwork of different styles, font types, bullet points, and so on, the text has  
to be formatted to match the rest of the presentation.
Unformatted text
It is good practice to paste text without formatting and apply the formatting later.
1) Highlight and copy the text from another document or slide.
2) Create a text box on a slide and make sure the text cursor is flashing in the text box. 
Alternatively, select an AutoLayout text box on a slide. See “ Text boxes” on page 246 and 
see “AutoLayout text boxes ” on page 245 and the Impress Guide for more information.
3) Paste unformatted text into the text box using one of the following methods. Text is 
pasted at the cursor position in the text box formatted using the Default Drawing Style, or  
Presentation Style if text was pasted into an AutoLayout text box.
– Go to Edit > Paste Special > Paste Unformatted Text  on the Menu bar.
– Click on the triangle ▼to the right of the Paste tool on the Standard toolbar and select 
Unformatted Text  in the context menu.
– Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+V (macOS +⌘Shift+V) and select 
Unformatted text on the dialog that opens.
4) Format the text to the presentation requirements using the tools on the Text Formatting 
toolbar, or the options in Format on the Menu bar.
Note
The Presentation style used in AutoLayout text boxes cannot be changed by 
selecting another presentation style. Make sure the AutoLayout text box uses the 
presentation style required. Change outline levels and outline styles using the Tab 
key or Shift+Tab key combination. See the Impress Guide for more information.
AutoLayout text box formatting of pasted text
If text is being pasted into an AutoLayout text box, the appropriate outline style has to be applied  
to the text giving it the same look and feel as the rest of the presentation.
1) Highlight and copy the text from another document or slide.
2) Paste the text into the AutoLayout text box, then select the pasted text.
Chapter 6,  Getting Started with Impress  | 2173) Select Format > Clear Direct Formatting  on the Menu bar, or use the keyboard 
shortcut Ctrl+Shift+M (macOS + ⌘Shift+M) to make sure any formatting is removed 
from the pasted text.
4) Use the four arrow buttons on the Outline toolbar to move the text to the appropriate 
position and give it the appropriate outline level.
– Left arrow promotes a list entry by one level (for example from Outline 3 to Outline 2). 
Alternatively, place the cursor at the beginning of the paragraph  and use the 
Shift+Tab keys.
– Right arrow demotes a list entry by one level. Alternatively, place the cursor at the 
beginning of the paragraph and use the Tab key.
– Up arrow moves a list entry up in the list order.
– Down arrow moves a list entry down in the list order.
5) If necessary, modify the presentation style to format the text to the presentation 
requirements to change font attributes, tabs, and so on. See the Impress Guide for more 
information. Alternatively, apply any necessary manual or direct formatting to the text.
Text box formatting of pasted text
Pasting formatted text into a text box overwrites any formatting and replaces the text box style.
1) Highlight and copy the text from another document or slide.
2) If necessary, create a text box on a slide and make sure the text cursor is flashing in the 
text box. See “Text boxes” on page 246 and the Impress Guide for more information.
3) Paste formatted text into the text box. Text is pasted at the cursor position in the text box 
and the text formatting of the pasted text overwrites any style formatting of the text box.
4) Select Format > Clear Direct Formatting  on the Menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut  
Ctrl+Shift+M (macOS + ⌘Shift+M) to make sure any formatting is removed from the 
pasted text.
5) Select the required drawing style to format the text from the available drawing styles.
6) If necessary, modify a drawing style or create a new drawing style to format the text to 
the presentation requirements. See the Impress Guide for more information.
Note
Drawing styles can be created in Impress and are only available for the presentation 
which is being created and has been saved. Templates can also be created that 
include any drawing styles required. For more information, see the Impress Guide.
Creating lists
The procedure to create an unordered (bulleted) or ordered (numbered) list varies depending on 
the type of text box used. The tools to manage and format a list are the same. To change the 
appearance of a list, see “ Changing list type” on page 250.
AutoLayout text boxes
In AutoLayout text boxes and by default, the outline styles available are unordered lists. An 
example of these outline styles is shown in Figure  153. These outline styles are presentation 
styles and cannot be deleted, but can be modified or updated to the presentation requirements. 
See the Impress Guide for more information.
218 |Getting Started 24.8Create a slide using an AutoLayout text box with an unordered list as follows:
1) Go to View > Normal on the Menu bar to open Normal view.
2) Select a layout for the slide using one of the following methods:
– Right-click in a blank area on the slide and select a layout in the context menu.
– Go to Slide > Layout on the Menu bar and select a layout in the drop-down list.
– Select a layout in the Layouts panel on the Properties deck in the Sidebar.
3) Click on the text ● Click to add Text  and start typing the first list item.
4) Press Enter to start a new list point or use the keyboard combination Shift+Enter to 
start a new line without creating a new list point. The new line will have the same 
indentation as the list point.

– Use the keyboard shortcut Alt+Shift+Up Arrow  (macOS ⌥+Shift+Up Arrow).
Note
In AutoLayout text boxes, promoting or demoting an item in the list corresponds to 
applying a different outline style. The second outline level corresponds to Outline 2 
style, the third outline level to Outline 3 style, and so on. A change in level and style 
produces other changes, for example, to font size, bullet type, and so on.
Text boxes
Create an unordered or ordered list in a text box as follows:
1) Create a text box on a slide and make sure the cursor is flashing in the text box. See

Bullets and Numbering  from the context menu.
If a list was created in an AutoLayout text box, then the Outline styles can be 
modified to change the list type and/or format. Changes made to an Outline style 
apply to all the slides that use that style. See the Impress Guide for more 
information.
Text in a presentation can be formatted into columns inside text boxes and objects. 
However, columns cannot be used on separate parts of text inside a text box or 
object. The whole of the text box or object has to be used for columns.
Text columns
The type of columns used in Impress are continuous flow columns. This means that when text 
reaches the bottom of a column, it automatically flows into the next column as text is added. This  
type of columns is also known as newspaper columns.
Note
Any text inside a text box, or graphic object, automatically flows into column format 
when the changes are saved.
1) Columns in text boxes and graphic objects are created as follows:
– For text boxes — click the border of a text box to select it so that the selection handles  
are displayed indicating that the text box is in edit mode.
– For graphic objects — double-click on a graphic object to select it so that the selection 
handles are displayed and the cursor flashes in the center of the object indicating that 
the object is in text edit mode.
2) Open the options for text columns using one of the following methods:

Inserting graphics, spreadsheets, and OLE objects
Graphics
Graphics, such as shapes, callouts, and arrows, are often useful to complement the text on a 
slide. These objects are handled much the same way as graphics in Draw. For more information 
on inserting graphics, see Chapter 7, Getting Started with Draw in this guide, the Impress Guide, 
or the Draw Guide.
Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets embedded in Impress include most of the functionality of Calc spreadsheets and 
are capable of performing complex calculations and data analysis. If the data has to be analyzed  
or formulas applied, then these operations are best performed in a Calc spreadsheet and the 
results displayed in an embedded Calc spreadsheet or in an Impress table. For more information  
on spreadsheets, see the Impress Guide and the Calc Guide.
OLE objects
Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) is a software technology that allows linking and 
embedding of spreadsheets, charts, drawings, formulas, and text files into an Impress 
presentation.
The major benefit of using OLE objects is that it provides a quick and easy method of editing the 
object using tools from the software used to create the object. These file types can all be created  
using LibreOffice and OLE objects can be created from new or from an existing file.
Chapter 6,  Getting Started with Impress  | 227When inserting a new OLE object into a presentation, it is only available in that presentation and 
can only be edited using Impress. For more information on inserting and formatting OLE objects,  
see the Impress Guide.
Working with master slides
A master slide is a slide that is used as the starting point for other slides. It is similar to a page 
style in LibreOffice Writer as it controls the basic formatting of all slides based on it. A 
presentation can have more than one master slide.
A master slide has a defined set of characteristics, including the background color, graphics, or 
gradients. It also can include objects (for example, logos, decorative lines) in the background; 
headers and footers; placement and size of text frames; and text formatting.
Styles
All of the characteristics of master slides are controlled by styles. The styles of any new slide 
created are inherited from the master slide from which it was created. In other words, the styles 
of the master slide are available and applied to all slides created from that master slide. 
Changing a style in a master slide results in changes to all the slides based on that master slide.  
It is possible to modify each individual slide without affecting the master slide.
Master slides have two types of styles — presentation styles and drawing styles. The 
presentation styles included with Impress can be modified, but new presentation styles cannot 
be created or deleted. The drawing styles included with Impress can be modified, but cannot be 
deleted. However, new drawing styles can be created and these drawing styles can be deleted.
Note
It is highly recommended to use the master slides whenever possible. However, 
there are occasions where manual changes are needed for a particular slide, for 
example editing an individual slide to enlarge the chart area when the text and chart 
layout is used.
Master slides
Impress comes with a collection of master slides, which are are shown on the Master Slides 
deck of the Sidebar (Figure  166).
Figure 166: Master Slides deck on Sidebar
228 |Getting Started 24.8This deck has three panels: Used in This Presentation , Recently Used, and Available for 
Use. Click the expand marker on the title bar of a panel to expand it and show thumbnails of the 
master slides, or click the collapse marker to collapse the panel to hide the thumbnails.
Each of the master slides shown in the Available for Use panel are from templates that are 
available in LibreOffice Impress:
• Presentation templates included when LibreOffice is installed on a computer.
• Templates have been created, or added from other sources.
If a new presentation is created without using one of the templates available, then a default 
master slide is available. This default master slide is a good starting point for creating master 
slides. An example of the default master slide is shown in Figure  167.
Figure 167: Default Master Slide

be played during slide transition.
5) To apply the same transition to all slides in the presentation, click Apply Transition to 
All Slides at the bottom of the Slides Transition deck.
Chapter 6,  Getting Started with Impress  | 241Figure 181: Slide Transition deck in Sidebar
6) To check how the transition looks, click Play at the bottom of the Slides Transition deck. 
Alternatively, to automatically preview how the transition looks when it is applied, select 
Automatic Preview  at the bottom of the Slides Transition deck.
7) In the Advance Slide section, select how the slides change in a presentation.
– On mouse click — each time the mouse is clicked, the presentation advances to the 
next slide.
– Automatically after  — enter a time in box to elapse before the next slide in the 
presentation advances into view.
Playing sounds or music
Sound or music can be played during a presentation as a transition effect. When using music in 
a presentation, make sure any copyright or license for the music is not being infringed.
1) Click on Slide Transition on the Sidebar to open the Slide Transition deck.
2) In the Slides pane, or Slide Sorter view in the Workspace, select the slide to add sound 
or music.
3) In the Modify Transition  panel, select a sound in the Sound drop-down list.
4) To play music, use the following steps to select a music file:
a) Select Other sound in the Sound drop-down list.
b) In the file browser window that opens, navigate to where the music file is located.
242 |Getting Started 24.8c) Select the music file required and click Play to check if the music is suitable.
d) If the music is suitable, click Open to add the music to the selected slide and close the  
file browser window.
5) To play a sound or music file continuously in the slide show, select the option Loop until 
next sound. The sound or music file restarts once it is finished until the next sound or 
music file that is inserted in the slide show.
Notes
Do not select the Apply Transition to All Slides  option, otherwise the selected music 
file restarts at every slide.
The sound or music file is linked to a presentation rather than embedded. If the 
presentation is going to be displayed on a different computer, remember to make 
sure that the music file is available on the computer where the presentation will be 
played. The link to the sound or music file must be established before starting the 
presentation.
Animation effects
Slide animations are similar to transitions, but they are applied to individual elements in a single 
slide, such as title, chart, shape, or individual bullet point. Animations can make a presentation 
more lively and memorable. However, as with transitions, heavy use of animations can be 
distracting and even annoying for an audience expecting a professional presentation.
Animations are best applied using Normal view in the Workspace so that individual objects on a 
single slide can easily be selected.
On a slide, an element, such as a graphic or an entire text box, has selection handles around it 
when selected. If a portion of the text in a text box is selected, any selection handles may not be 
visible. For more information on animation effects, see the Impress Guide.
1) Go to View > Normal on the Menu bar to open Normal view in the Workspace.
2) Select an element on a slide for animation.
3) On the Sidebar, select Animation to open the Animation deck (Figure  182).

Chapter 7, 
Getting Started with Draw
Vector Drawing in LibreOfficeIntroduction
LibreOffice Draw is the vector graphics drawing module included with the LibreOffice installation.  
It can be used to create a wide variety of graphic images, including some operations on raster 
graphics.
Vector graphics store and display an image as an assembly of simple geometric elements such 
as lines, circles, and polygons, rather than a collection of pixels (points on the screen). Vector 
graphics allow for easier storage and image scaling.
LibreOffice Draw is fully integrated into the LibreOffice suite simplifying exchanging graphics 
between all LibreOffice modules. If an image is created in LibreOffice Draw, reusing it in a 
LibreOffice Writer document is relatively easy. For example, select and copy a drawing in 
LibreOffice Draw, then paste the copied image directly into a LibreOffice Writer document. Also, 
drawings can be worked on directly from within LibreOffice Writer or Impress, using a subset 
functions and tools from LibreOffice Draw.
The functionality of LibreOffice Draw is extensive has not been designed to rival high-end 
graphics applications. However, LibreOffice Draw has more functionality than drawing tools that 
are available in the majority of office productivity suites. A few examples of drawing functions are  
as follows:
• Layer management
• Magnetic grid-point system
• Dimensions and measurement display
• Connectors for making organization charts and other diagrams
• 3D functions for creating small three-dimensional drawings
• Drawing and page-style integration
• Bézier curves
This chapter introduces some features of LibreOffice Draw, but does not cover all the available 
features in LibreOffice Draw. See the LibreOffice Draw Guide  and LibreOffice Help for more 
information.
Notes
When LibreOffice is installed on a computer, a menu entry for each module is added 
to the system menu. The exact name and location of these menu entries depends on  
the operating system and graphical user interface being used.
The New icon displayed on the Standard toolbar depends on which LibreOffice 
module is open when creating a new document, presentation, spreadsheet, or 
drawing.
Main window
Pages pane
In LibreOffice Draw, drawings can be split over several pages with multi-page drawings used 
mainly for presentations. The Pages pane, on the left side of the main window, provides an 
overview pages created in a drawing. If the Pages pane is not visible, select View > Page Pane  
on the Menu bar. To make changes to the page order, drag and drop one or more pages 
displayed in the Pages pane.
248 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 186: LibreOffice Draw Main Window
(1) Pages pane
(2) Workspace(3) Sidebar
(4) Status Bar(5) Layers Bar
Workspace
The large area in the center of the main window (Figure  186) is the Workspace where drawings 
are created. This drawing area can be surrounded with toolbars and information areas. The 
number and position of visible tools varies with the task being carried out, user preferences, and 
computer setup. The maximum size of a drawing page in LibreOffice Draw is limited by computer  
setup and the page size that that can be set and used in a printer connected to the computer.
Sidebar
The Sidebar in LibreOffice Draw has five main decks and is similar to the Sidebar in other 
LibreOffice modules. To open a deck, click on its icon on the right of the Sidebar, or click on 
Sidebar Settings at the top of the Sidebar and select a deck from the drop-down list. If the 
Sidebar is not visible, select View > Sidebar on the Menu bar, or use the keyboard shortcut 
Ctrl+F5 (macOS ⌘+F5).
Properties
Contains panels where properties of a selected object in a drawing are changed: Page, 
Character, Paragraph, Image, Area, Line, Effect, Shadow, Position and Size , and 
Columns. Available panels depend on the selected object.
Styles
Provides options to edit and apply available Drawing Styles to objects in a drawing. 
When a style is edited or modified, changes are automatically applied to all elements 
formatted using that style. In LibreOffice Draw, Presentation Styles  are not available. 
New drawing styles can be added to a drawing.
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 249Gallery
Objects on the Gallery deck are inserted into a drawing either as a copy or as a link. The 
Gallery is divided into themes: Arrows, BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), 
Bullets, Diagrams, Flow chart, Icons, Network, Shapes, and Sounds. New themes 
are added to the Gallery. See Chapter 11, Advanced Draw Techniques for more 
information on using the Gallery.
Navigator
On the Navigator deck, pages and objects in a drawing are quickly selected. It is 
recommended to use meaningful names for pages and objects in a drawing for easy 
identification and location when using the Navigator.
Shapes
Provides quick selection of some items available on the Drawing toolbar: Lines and 
Arrows, Curves and Polygons , Connectors, Basic Shapes, Symbol Shapes, Block 
Arrows, Flowchart, Callouts, Stars and Banners , and 3D Objects.
Status bar
The Status Bar (Figure 187) is located at the bottom of the Workspace in all LibreOffice 
modules and includes several LibreOffice Draw specific fields. For content details and use of 
these fields, see Chapter 1, LibreOffice Basics, and the LibreOffice Draw Guide . To hide the 
Status Bar, select View on the Menu bar and deselect Status Bar from the submenu.

Note
The measurement units displayed on the Status Bar are set by going to Tools > 
Options > LibreOffice Draw > General  (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > 
LibreOffice > General ) on the Menu bar. These measurement units can be different 
to the measurement units set for the rulers displayed in the LibreOffice Draw main 
window.
Layers bar
A layer is a workplace where drawing elements and objects can be inserted. By default, the 
Workspace consists of three layers ( Layout, Controls and Dimension Lines). Tabs for the 
default layers appear at the bottom of the Workspace. Default layers cannot be deleted or 
renamed, but layers can be added when required.
Tabs for layers appear in the Layers bar at the bottom of the Workspace. Use the Layers bar to 
navigate between layers, add layers as required, or delete layers that have been created. For 
more information on layers, see “ Working with layers ” on page 313.
250 |Getting Started 24.8Rulers
Rulers are positioned on the Workspace upper and left-hand sides. If the rulers are not visible, 
select View > Rulers in the Menu bar, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+R 
(macOS ⌘+Shift+R). The rulers show the size of a selected object on the page using double 
lines (highlighted in Figure  188). Also, rulers are used to manage object handles and guide lines 
when positioning objects.
Figure 188: Example of rulers showing object size
Page margins in the drawing area are represented on the rulers. Change the margins directly on  
the rulers by dragging with the cursor. Margin areas are normally indicated by a grayed out area 
on the rulers, but does depend on computer operating system and setup.
To change the ruler measurement units, right-click on a ruler and select the measurement unit 
from the drop down list, as shown in Figure  189 for the horizontal ruler. Measurement units for 
the horizontal and vertical rulers can be different measurement units.
Figure 189: Example of ruler measurement units
Toolbars
To display or hide the LibreOffice Draw toolbars, select View > Toolbars on the Menu bar and 
select the required toolbar from the submenu. For more information on toolbars, see the 
LibreOffice Draw Guide .
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 251The icons used for the tools on each toolbar depend on the computer operating system and how  
LibreOffice has been set up on a computer. For more information, see Chapter 12, Configuring 
LibreOffice. The four main toolbars used in LibreOffice Draw are as follows:
Standard toolbar
The Standard toolbar (Figure  190) is similar for all LibreOffice modules. By default, it is 
locked into position at the top of the main window when a document is opened.
Figure 190: Standard toolbar
Drawing toolbar
The Drawing toolbar (Figure  191) contains all the necessary functions for drawing 
various geometric and freehand shapes, and for organizing them in the drawing. By 
default, it is locked into position on the left of the main window.
Figure 191: Drawing toolbar
Line and Filling toolbar
The Line and Filling toolbar (Figure  192) is normally docked at the top of the main 
window below the Standard toolbar and is used to modify the main properties of a 
drawing object. The tools and pull-down lists vary according to the type of object 
selected. The Line and Filling toolbar only becomes active when an object on the 
Workspace is selected.
Figure 192: Line and Filling toolbar
Text Formatting toolbar
The Text Formatting toolbar (Figure  193) is similar to the Formatting toolbar in LibreOffice  
Writer. It is only available when text, or a text object, has been selected in a drawing. The  
Text Formatting toolbar replaces the Line and Filling toolbar when it opens.
252 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 193: Text Formatting toolbar
Drawing basic shapes
LibreOffice Draw provides a wide range of basic shapes located on the Drawing toolbar 
(Figure 191 on page 287) and the Shapes deck on the Sidebar (Figure  194). Some of the basic 
shape icons on the Drawing toolbar change according to the shape that has been selected. Also,  
some basic shapes on a toolbar have a subtoolbar available and these are indicated by a 
triangle ▼ to the right of the tool icon. See the LibreOffice Draw Guide  for a complete description  
of the basic shapes available and how to access the subtoolbars.
Figure 194: Shapes deck on Sidebar
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 253Note
When drawing basic shapes, or selecting a shape for editing, the information area in 
the Status bar changes to reflect the present action, for example Line created, 
Text frame xxyy  selected, and so on.
Straight lines
A straight line is the simplest element or object to create in LibreOffice Draw.
1) Use one of the following methods to start drawing a line:
– Click on Insert Line on the Drawing toolbar (Figure  191 on page 287).
– Click the triangle ▼ on the right of Lines and Arrows  on the Drawing toolbar and 
select Insert Line in the context menu.
– Click on Insert Line in the Lines and Arrows  panel in the Shapes deck on the 
Sidebar (Figure 194).
2) Place the cursor at the starting point on the drawing, then click and drag the cursor to 
draw a straight line.
3) Release the cursor when the end point is reached and a straight line is created. A 
selection handle appears at each end of the line, showing that this object is selected. 
The selection handle at the starting point of the line is larger than the end point 
(highlighted in Figure  195).
Figure 195: Example of line starting point
A line is drawn using default attributes. To change line attributes and format a line to the drawing 
requirements, select the line by clicking on it and use one of the following methods to access 
formatting options for the line:
• Go to the Properties deck on the Sidebar and open the Line panel (Figure 196).
• Right-click on a line and select Line in the context menu to open the Line dialog 
(Figure 197).
• Go to Format > Line on the Menu bar to open the Line dialog.
• Use the tools Line Style, Line Width, and Line Color on the Line and Filling toolbar 
(Figure 192 on page 287).
254 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 196: Line panel in Properties deck on Sidebar
Figure 197: Line dialog — Line page
Tips
To snap the end of a line to the nearest grid point, keep the Ctrl key (macOS ) ⌘
pressed while drawing the line. However, if the Snap to Grid option in View > Snap 
Guides on the Menu bar is selected, the Ctrl key (macOS ) deactivates the snap ⌘  
to grid.
To restrict the drawing angle of a line to multiples of 45 degrees, keep the Shift key 
pressed while drawing the line. However, if the option When creating or moving 
objects in the Constrain Objects section of Tools > Options > LibreOffice Draw > 
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 255Grid (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > LibreOffice Draw > Grid ) has been 
selected, the Shift key deactivates this restriction.
To draw a line symmetrically outwards in both directions from the start point, keep 
the Alt key (macOS ) pressed while drawing the line. Lines are drawn starting ⌥
from the center of the line.
Lines and Arrows
LibreOffice Draw classifies both lines and arrows as lines. Arrows are drawn like straight lines. 
Hovering the cursor over each tool in the Lines and Arrows subtoolbar (Figure  198) indicates 
what type of line, or arrow each tool creates. The information field on the Status bar shows them 
only as lines.
Figure 198: Lines and Arrows subtoolbar
1) Use one of the following methods to draw a line or arrow:
– Click the triangle ▼ on the right of Lines and Arrows  on the Drawing toolbar and 
select the type of arrow required from the Lines and Arrows sub-toolbar.
– Click on the type of arrow required in the Lines and Arrows  panel of the Shapes deck  
on the Sidebar (Figure  194 on page 288).
2) Place the cursor at the starting point of the line or arrow, then click and drag the cursor. 
The arrowhead is created when the cursor is released.
Notes
The tool icon for the Lines and Arrows  tool previously used is shown on the 
Drawing toolbar making it easier to use the same tool again.
After drawing a line, or arrow, the line, or arrow style is changed by opening the Line 
dialog (Figure 197 on page 290) and using the options available on the Line Styles 
or Arrow Styles pages.
Rectangles or Squares
1) Use one of the following methods to start drawing a rectangle or square:
– Click on Rectangle on the Drawing toolbar.
– Click the triangle ▼ on the right of Basic Shapes on the Drawing toolbar and select 
Rectangle or Square on the Basic Shapes subtoolbar (Figure  199).
Figure 199: Basic Shapes subtoolbar
256 |Getting Started 24.8– Click on Rectangle or Square in the Basic Shapes panel of the Shapes deck on the 
Sidebar (Figure 194 on page 288).
– Select the type of rectangle or square on the Legacy Rectangles toolbar (Figure  200). 
To display the toolbar, go to View > Toolbars on the Menu bar and select it.
Figure 200: Legacy Rectangles toolbar
2) Place the cursor at the starting point for the rectangle or square, then click and drag the 
cursor until the required size is drawn. The rectangle or square is drawn from the starting  
point using the bottom right corner as the anchor point for the cursor.
3) If necessary, use one of the following options to draw a rectangle or square:
– If a rectangle option is selected, hold down the Shift key while dragging the cursor to 
draw a square.
– If a rectangle option is selected, hold down the Alt key while dragging the cursor to 
draw a rectangle from its center.
– If a rectangle option is selected, hold down the Shift and Alt keys while dragging the  
cursor to draw a square from its center.
– If a square option is selected, hold down the Shift key while dragging the cursor to 
draw a rectangle.
– If a square option is selected, hold down the Alt key while dragging the cursor to draw  
a square from its center.
Note
If the option When creating or moving objects  is selected in the Constrain Object 
section of Tools > Options > LibreOffice Draw > Grid  (macOS LibreOffice> 
Preferences > LibreOffice Draw > Grid ), the Shift key action is reversed. A 
square is drawn instead of a rectangle. Holding down the Shift key a rectangle is 
drawn. Shift key action reversal also applies to ellipses, circles, arcs, and 
segments.
Ellipses or circles
1) Use one of the following methods to start drawing an ellipse or circle:
– Click on Ellipse on the Drawing toolbar.
– Select the type of ellipse or circle in the Basic Shapes panel in Shapes deck on the 
Sidebar (Figure 194 on page 288).
– Click on the triangle ▼ next to Basic Shapes on the Drawing toolbar and select the 
type of ellipse or circle required from the drop-down list.
– Select the type of ellipse or circle on the Legacy Circles and Ovals toolbar 
(Figure 201). To display the Legacy Circles and Ovals toolbar, go to View > Toolbars 
on the Menu bar and select it.
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 257Figure 201: Legacy Circles and Ovals toolbar
2) Place the cursor at the starting point for the ellipse or circle, then click and drag the 
cursor until the required size is drawn. The ellipse or circle is drawn from the starting 
point using the bottom right corner as the anchor point for the cursor.
3) If necessary, use one of the following options while drawing an ellipse or circle:
– If an ellipse option is selected, hold down the Shift key while dragging the cursor to 
draw a circle.
– If an ellipse option is selected, hold down the Alt key while dragging the cursor to 
draw an ellipse from its center.
– If an ellipse option is selected, hold down the Shift and Alt keys while dragging the 
cursor to draw a circle from its center.
– If a circle option is selected, hold down the Shift key while dragging the cursor to 
draw an ellipse.
– If a circle option is selected, hold down the Alt key while dragging the cursor to draw 
a circle from its center.
Tip
To quickly insert an object, press and hold down the Ctrl (macOS ) key, then click ⌘ 
on an object tool on the Drawing toolbar. A standard sized object of the selected 
object is drawn automatically in the center of the Workspace. The size, shape, and 
color used are default settings. These attributes can be changed later. For more 
information, see the Draw Guide.
Dimension lines
Dimension lines display a measurement of an object in the drawing (Figure  202). A dimension 
line does not belong to the object itself, but is positioned close to it. An object can have as many 
dimension lines as necessary to indicate the dimensions of sides, edges, distances, and so on.
Figure 202: Example of object dimension lines
1) Use one of the following methods to start drawing a dimension line:
258 |Getting Started 24.8Click the triangle ▼ on the right of Lines and Arrows  on the Drawing toolbar and select 
Dimension Line on the Lines and Arrows sub-toolbar that opens.
– Click on Dimension Line in the Lines and Arrows  panel of the Shapes deck on the 
Sidebar.
2) Place the cursor close to the object to position the start of the dimension line.
3) Click and drag the cursor to draw the dimension line. As the dimension line is drawn, the 
dimension is displayed and automatically calculated. To change the measurement unit 
used for dimension lines, go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice Draw > General  on the 
Menu bar.
4) To change the display of a dimension line and its appearance, right-click on the 
dimension line and select Dimensions in the context menu to open the Dimension Line 
dialog (Figure 203).
5) Select the required options in Line and Legend, then click OK to save the changes and 
close the Line Dimension dialog.
Figure 203: Dimension Line dialog
Curves
1) Use one of the following methods to start drawing a curve:
– Click the triangle ▼ on the right of Curves and Polygons  on the Drawing toolbar and 
select the type of curve on the Curves and Polygons subtoolbar (Figure  204).
– Click on the type of curve required in the Curves and Polygons  panel of the Shapes 
deck on the Sidebar.
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 259Figure 204: Curves and Polygons subtoolbar
2) Click and hold the left mouse button to create the starting point of the curve, then drag 
from the starting point to draw a line. Release the mouse button and continue to drag the  
cursor to bend the line into a curve.
3) Double-click to set the end point of the curve and fix the curve on the drawing. A filled 
curve automatically joins the last point to the first point, closing the curve and filling it with  
the selected fill color. A curve without fill will not be closed at the end of drawing the 
curve.
Note
A single click fixes the curve to the drawing and allows drawing of straight lines from 
the end of the curve. Each single click allows the drawing of another straight line. 
Double-click to end drawing a curve with straight lines.
Polygons
1) Use one of the following methods to start drawing a polygon:
– Click the triangle ▼ on the right of Curves and Polygons  on the Drawing toolbar and 
select the type of polygon on the Curves and Polygons subtoolbar (Figure  204).
– Click on the type of polygon required in the Curves and Polygons  panel of the 
Shapes deck on the Sidebar.
2) Click to create the starting point of the polygon, then drag from the starting point to draw 
a line.
3) Release the hold and continue to drag the cursor to draw the next line for polygon, then 
click again to mark the end point of the line and start drawing another line. Holding the 
Shift key down while drawing lines restricts the angles used in the polygon to 45° or 
90°.
Polygons 45°
A polygon 45° is drawn using the same procedure as polygons, but the angles between lines are  
restricted to 45° or 90°. This restriction of angles cannot be changed. However, hold down the 
Shift key to draw a line at an angle other than 45 or 90 degrees.
A filled polygon 45° automatically joins the last point to the first point, closing the polygon and 
filling it with the selected fill.
Free-form lines
Drawing a free-form line is similar to drawing with a pencil on paper.
1) Use one of the following methods to start drawing a free-form line:
– Click the triangle ▼ on the right of Curves and Polygons  on the Drawing toolbar and 
select the type of free-form line on the Curves and Polygons subtoolbar (Figure  204).
– Click on the type of free-form line required in the Curves and Polygons  panel of the 
Shapes deck on the Sidebar.
260 |Getting Started 24.82) Click and drag the cursor to create the free-form line shape required.
3) Release the hold when satisfied with the free-form line and the drawing is completed. A 
filled free-form line automatically joins the last point to the first point, closing the free-form  
line and filling it with the selected fill.
Gluepoints and connectors
Gluepoints
All LibreOffice Draw objects have gluepoints and are not normally displayed. Gluepoints 
(Figure 205) only become visible on an object when a connector is selected on the Drawing 
toolbar or in the Shapes deck on the Sidebar.
Figure 205: Example of object gluepoints
Most objects have four gluepoints (Figure  205). More gluepoints can be added and customized 
using the Gluepoints toolbar (Figure  206). If the Gluepoints toolbar is not visible, go to View > 
Toolbars > Gluepoints  on the Menu bar to open the toolbar. For a more detailed description on 
adding and using gluepoints, see the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
Figure 206: Gluepoints toolbar
Figure 207: Example of a connector between objects
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 261Gluepoints are not the same as the selection handles of an object. Selection handles are for 
moving or changing the shape of an object. Gluepoints are used to fix or glue a connector to an 
object so that when the object moves, the connector stays fixed to the object.
Connectors
Connectors are lines or arrows whose ends automatically snap to a gluepoint of an object. 
Connectors are especially useful in drawing organization charts, flow diagrams, and mind-maps. 
When objects are moved or reordered, the connectors remain attached to a gluepoint. 
Figure 207 shows an example of using two objects and a connector. For a more detailed 
description of the use of connectors, see the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
1) Use one of the following methods to select a connector:
– Click the triangle ▼ on the right of Connectors on the Drawing toolbar and select the 
type of connector on the Connectors subtoolbar (Figure  208).
– Click on the type of connector required in the Connectors panel of the Shapes deck 
on the Sidebar.
Figure 208: Connectors subtoolbar
2) Move the cursor over one of the objects to be connected. Small crosses (the gluepoints) 
appear around the object edges. Click on the required gluepoint for the start of the 
connector, then drag the cursor to drag the connector to another object.
3) When the cursor is over a gluepoint of the target object, release the mouse button and 
the connector is drawn. The connector end point is attached to the gluepoint.
Geometric shapes
Geometric shapes are similar to basic shapes. They are provided in LibreOffice Draw as a 
starting point when creating objects for a drawing. Geometric shapes are located on the Drawing  
toolbar and in the Shapes deck on the Sidebar.
The tool icons on the Drawing toolbar always indicate the last geometric shape drawn. This 
makes it easier to use the same tool again.
Access geometric shapes using one of the following methods:
• Click on Shapes on the Sidebar to open the Shapes deck, then choose from the 
geometric shapes available.
• Click the triangle ▼ on the right of a geometric shape on the Drawing toolbar to open a 
sub-toolbar giving access to more geometric shape tools.
Using geometric shapes is similar to drawing rectangles, squares, ellipses, or circles as 
explained in “Drawing basic shapes ” on page 288. Text can be added to all geometric shapes. 
See “Adding and formatting text ” on page 300 and the LibreOffice Draw Guide .

Adding and formatting text
Text can be added to drawings created in LibreOffice Draw. This section gives some guidelines 
on how to add text and change its appearance. Text added to drawings can be contained in text 
boxes, objects, or shapes. For more information on adding and formatting text, see the 
LibreOffice Draw Guide .
• A text box is an independent object that is dynamic and expands as more text is added 
within the frame.
• An object or shape in a drawing is not dynamic, which means that the boundary 
rectangle does not expand as text is added. Care must be taken when adding text to 
prevent the text from extending outside the object or shape boundaries.
Text mode
Before adding any text to a drawing, text mode has to be activated using one of the following 
methods. The Text Formatting toolbar (Figure  216) automatically opens when text mode is 
activated, replacing the Line and Filling toolbar.
Figure 216: Text Formatting toolbar
• For horizontal text, click on Insert Text Box on the Drawing or Text toolbar to create a 
text box.
• For horizontal text, go to Insert > Text Box on the Menu bar to create a text box.
• For horizontal text, use the keyboard shortcut F2 to create a text box.
• For vertical text, click on Insert Vertical Text  on the Drawing or Text toolbar to create a 
vertical text box.
• Double-click inside an object on the drawing and the object switches to text mode with a 
flashing cursor inside the object.
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 265Note
Inserting and formatting vertical text and vertical text boxes is the same as horizontal  
text and horizontal text boxes. A vertical text box expands vertically as text is added 
into the box. For more information on vertical text, see the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
Text boxes
1) Create a text box in the drawing using one of the following methods. The Status Bar 
indicates Text Edit mode and the position of the cursor (Figure  217).
Figure 217: Example of text information on Status Bar
– Click at the approximate position for the text box and a single line text box is created 
containing a flashing cursor. Start typing the text or paste copied text into the text box. 
The width of a single line text box increases as text is added.
– Click at the approximate position for the text and drag the cursor to the approximate 
width required for the text box creating a multi-line text box. Start typing the text, or 
paste copied text into the text box. As the horizontal limit of the text box is reached, the  
text automatically word wraps inside the text box and the text box expands vertically 
as it fills.
– If necessary, create multiple lines of text in a single-line text box by pressing Enter to 
create a new paragraph, or using Shift+Enter to create a line break in the text.
2) When adding text is complete, click outside the text box to exit text mode. The Text 
Formatting toolbar closes and the Line and Filling toolbar opens in its original position.
3) To format and/or reposition the text box, see the LibreOffice Draw Guide  for more 
information.
Vertical text
By default, LibreOffice Draw is set for horizontal text only. Enabling vertical text is as follows:
1) Go to Tools > Options > Language Settings > Languages  (macOS LibreOffice > 
Preferences > Language Settings > Languages ).
2) Under Default Languages for Documents , select Asian and accept the default 
language displayed.
3) Right-click in a blank area on the Drawing toolbar and select Visible Buttons in the 
context menu.
4) Select Insert Vertical Text  from the list of available tools to enable vertical text on the 
Drawing toolbar.
5) Alternatively, go to View > Toolbars on the Menu bar and select the Text toolbar from the  
drop-down list, then select Insert Vertical Text  from the tools available on the Text 
toolbar.
266 |Getting Started 24.8Text in LibreOffice Draw objects
Text can be added to most LibreOffice Draw objects. The exceptions are, for example, control 
elements, buttons, polygons, curves, or 3D objects.
By default, an object is not dynamic when created in LibreOffice Draw and does not behave like 
a text box. Text added to an object does not word wrap inside an object. To keep text within the 
borders of an object, use word wrap, paragraphs, line breaks, smaller text size, increasing object  
size, or a combination of all methods. For more information on adding text to objects, see the 
LibreOffice Draw Guide .
1) Create an object in a drawing and make sure the object is selected with the selection 
handles displayed.
2) Enter text mode on a selected object using one of the following methods:
– Click on Insert Text Box for horizontal text, or Insert Vertical Text  for vertical text on 
the Drawing, or Text toolbar.
– For horizontal text, double-click on the selected object.
– For vertical text, double-click on the selected object and click on Insert Vertical Text  
on the Drawing, or Text toolbar.
3) Type or paste text into the selected object. 
4) If the text goes outside the object borders, format the text using the various tools on the 
Text Formatting toolbar, panels in the Properties deck on the Sidebar, options in Format 
on the Menu bar, or Text page in the Text dialog. For more information on text formatting,  
see the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
5) Click outside the object to deselect it ending text mode and saving any changes.
Creating lists
Unordered (bulleted) or ordered (numbered) lists can be created in text boxes and objects. For 
more information on creating and formatting lists, see the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
1) Switch on text mode and select all of the text required for a list, or type the required text.
2) Create a list using one of the following methods and default settings for lists:
– Click on Toggle Unordered List , or Toggle Ordered List  on the Text Formatting 
toolbar.
– Click on Toggle Unordered List , or Toggle Ordered List  in the Lists panel in the 
Properties deck on the Sidebar.
– Go to Format > Lists > Unordered List , or Ordered List on the Menu bar.
3) To change the format of the list, click on the triangle ▼ on the right of the list tools in the 
toolbars, or List panel in the Sidebar, and select a list style from the options available.
Text columns
Text in a drawing can be formatted into columns inside text boxes and objects. However, if text 
columns are to be used in a text box or object, then the whole of a text box or object has to be 
used for columns. For more information on text columns, see the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
Note
Any text inside a text box, or graphic object automatically flows into column format 
when the changes are saved.
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 2671) For text boxes — click the border of a text box to select it so that the selection handles 
are displayed indicating that the text box is in edit mode.
2) For graphic objects — double-click on a graphic object to select it so that the selection 
handles are displayed and the cursor flashes in the center of the object indicating that 
the object is in text edit mode.
3) Open the options for text columns using one of the following methods:
– Right-click in the text box or graphic object and select Text Attributes in the context 
menu to open the Text dialog, then click on the Text Columns tab to open the Text 
Columns page,
– Click on Columns in the Properties deck on the Sidebar to open the Columns panel.
4) Set the number of columns required in the Number of columns  box and the required 
spacing between the columns in the Spacing box.
5) Type in the required text, or use copy and paste to enter the required text into the text 
box or graphic object. Any text entered will be in column format.
6) If necessary, format the text to the drawing requirements.
7) Save the changes and deselect the text box, or graphic object, using one of the following  
methods:
– For the Text dialog, click OK to save the changes and close the dialog, then click 
outside the text box to deselect it.
– For the Columns panel in the Properties deck on the Sidebar, click outside the text 
box or graphic object to deselect it and save the changes.
8) Click outside the text box, or graphic object, to deselect and save all the changes.
Selecting objects
Direct selection
The easiest way to select an object is to click directly on it. For objects that are not filled, click on  
the object border to select it. To select, or deselect, more than one object, hold the Shift key 
down while clicking on each object.
Selection by framing
Several objects can be selected at the same time by clicking and dragging the cursor to create a  
selection rectangle (also known as a marquee) around objects. Only objects that lie entirely 
within this selection rectangle are selected. To select multiple objects by framing, Select on the 
Drawing toolbar must be active.
Selecting hidden objects
If objects are located behind others and not visible, they can still be selected. When selecting a 
hidden object, its selection handles appear through the objects covering it.
• Windows, macOS or Linux  — press the Tab key to select and cycle through the 
objects in a drawing, stopping at the hidden object to select it. To cycle through the 
objects in reverse order, press Shift+Tab.
• Windows or macOS only  — select the object in front of a hidden object, then press the 
Alt key (macOS ) and click to select the hidden object. If there are several hidden ⌥
objects, keep holding down the Alt key (macOS ) ⌥ and clicking until the object 
268 |Getting Started 24.8required is reached. To cycle through the objects in reverse order, hold down the 
Alt+Shift keys (macOS + ⌥Shift) and click.
Arranging objects
In a complex drawing, several objects may be stacked on top of one another. This stacking order  
can be rearranged by moving an object forward, or backward, using one of the following 
methods:
• Select an object, go to Shape > Arrange on the Menu bar, or right-click on the object 
and select Arrange in the drop-down menu, then choose one of the following options:
– Bring to Front (Ctrl+Shift++) (macOS + ⌘Shift++) 
– Bring Forward (Ctrl++) (macOS ++) ⌘
– Send Backward (Ctrl+-) (macOS +–) ⌘
– Send to Back (Ctrl+Shift+-) (macOS + ⌘Shift+–)
– In Front of Object
– Behind Object
– Reverse — clicking on this option reverses the order of the selected objects.
• Select an object, then click on one of the Arrange tools, as above, on the Line and 
Filling toolbar. When hovering the cursor over a tool, its function is indicated.
Positioning and adjusting objects
When positioning or changing the size of an object, check the information area of the Status bar 
at the bottom of the Workspace (Figure  218). From left to right, it shows what object is selected, 
its position on the drawing in X/Y coordinates, and the dimensions of the object.
Figure 218: Example of object information on StatusBar
 The measurement units are those selected in Tools > Options > LibreOffice Draw > General . 
For more information on positioning and adjusting objects, see the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
Using zoom
To help in the positioning and adjustment of objects, LibreOffice Draw has a zoom function that 
reduces or enlarges the screen display of the current drawing. For example, zoom in to position 
objects on a drawing with greater accuracy; zoom out to see the complete drawing. Zooming is 
controlled using the Status bar, Zoom & View Layout dialog, or Zoom toolbar. For more 
information on using zoom, see the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 269Moving objects
To move an object (or a group of objects), select it within the object borders, then click and drag 
the object. Release the object when it is in its correct position. Whilst moving the object, a ghost 
image of the object appears helping with repositioning (Figure  219).
Figure 219: Example of moving objects
Adjusting object size
To change the size of a selected object (or a group of selected objects), move the cursor to one 
of the selection handles. The cursor changes shape to indicate the direction of movement for 
that selection handle. As the object size changes, a ghosted outline of the object appears 
(Figure 220). When the desired size of the object is reached, release the object.
Figure 220: Example of adjusting object size
The results depend on which selection handle is being used. To resize an object along one axis, 
use a side, top, or bottom handle. To resize along both axes, use a corner handle.
Note
Press and hold the Shift key while resizing an object, the change in size is carried 
out symmetrically with respect to the object width and height maintaining the aspect 
ratio of the object. This Shift key behavior works on all selection handles.
270 |Getting Started 24.8Rotating or slanting objects
To rotate or slant an object (or a group of objects), select it and switch to rotation mode using 
one of the following methods:
• Right-click on the object and select Transformations > Rotate  in the context menu.
• Click on the triangle ▼ on the right of Transformations on the Standard or Line & Filling  
toolbars and select Rotate.
The selection handles change shape and color with a center of rotation appearing in the center 
of the object. As the cursor is moved over the handles, the cursor changes shape to indicate the 
type of movement.
Rotation
1) Click on and hold a corner selection handle, then drag the cursor to rotate the object 
around the rotation point. A ghost image of the object rotation appears and the current 
angle of rotation is shown in the Status Bar (Figure  221).
Figure 221: Example of rotating an object
2) When the object is at the required rotation angle, release the object.
3) To change the type of rotation, click on the rotation point and drag it to another position. 
The rotation point can be moved outside of the object boundaries.
Note
Press the Shift key while rotating or slanting an object and the movement is 
restricted to 15°.
Slanting
1) Click on a selection handle at the top, bottom, left side, or right side of an object. The 
cursor will change shape indicating the direction of movement.
2) Drag the selection handle to slant the object. A ghost image of the object being slanted 
appears (Figure 222) and the current slant angle is shown in the Status Bar. The axis 
used for slanting an object is fixed to the edge of the object directly opposite the 
selection handle being used to slant the object.
3) When the object is at the desired slant angle, release the object.
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 271Figure 222: Example of slanting an object
Flipping objects
Select an object so that the selection handles are displayed and flip the object vertically or 
horizontally using one of the following methods:
• Right-click on the object and select Flip > Vertically, or Horizontally, in the context 
menu.
• Go to Shape > Flip > Vertically , or Horizontally, on the Menu bar.
• Click on Vertically, or Horizontally, tool on the Line and Filling toolbar.
• Use Flip Vertically, or Flip Horizontally, tool in the Position and Size section on the 
Properties deck of the Sidebar.
However, the Flip tool on the Transformations toolbar (Figure  223) provides greater control over 
the flipping process. Use the Flip tool to change the position and angle that the object flips over. 
See the LibreOffice Draw Guide  for more information.
Figure 223: Transformations toolbar
Object distortion
Three tools on the Transformations toolbar (Figure  223) allow the dragging of the corners and 
edges of an object to distort an object.
• Distort — distorts an object in perspective.
• Set in Circle (perspective)  — creates a pseudo 3D effect.
• Set to Circle (slant)  — creates a pseudo 3D effect. Despite the (slant) in the name of 
this tool, it operates differently from the slanting created by rotation.
In all three cases, the object has to be converted into a curve. This is a necessary first step, so 
click Yes, then move the object handles to produce the desired effect. See the LibreOffice Draw 
Guide for more information on how to distort an object.
Dynamic gradients
Transparency gradients can be controlled the same as color gradients and both types of gradient  
can be used together. With a transparency gradient, the direction and degree of the object fill 
color changes from opaque to transparent. In a color gradient, the fill changes from one color to 
272 |Getting Started 24.8another, but the degree of transparency remains the same. An example of a dynamic gradient is 
shown in Figure 224.
Two tools on the Transformations toolbar are used to dynamically control transparency and color  
gradients — Interactive Transparency  and Interactive Gradient . See the LibreOffice Draw 
Guide for more information on how to create transparencies and gradients in an object.
Figure 224: Example of a dynamic gradient
Duplication
Duplication makes copies of an object while applying a set of changes such as Color or rotation 
to the duplicates that are created. An example of duplication is shown in Figure  225. For more 
information on duplication, see the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
Figure 225: Example of duplicating objects
1) Click on an object or group of objects and open the Duplicate dialog (Figure  226) using 
one of the following methods:
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 273Figure 226: Duplicate dialog
– Go to Edit > Duplicate on the Menu bar.
– Go to Shape > Duplicate  on the Menu bar.
– Use the keyboard shortcut Shift+F3.
2) Select the required options in Number of copies , Placement, Enlargement, and 
Colors.
3) Click OK to duplicate the object and close the Duplicate dialog.
Cross-fading
Cross-fading transforms one object shape to another object shape. The result is a new group of 
objects with the first object selected as the start object and the second object selected as the 
end object. For example, when the options in the Cross-fading dialog are applied to a rectangle 
and an oval, the cross-fading produces the result shown by the example in Figure  227.
Figure 227: Example of cross fading objects
1) Select two differently shaped objects and go to Shape > Cross-fading  on the Menu bar 
to open the Cross-fading dialog (Figure  228).
274 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 228: Cross-fading dialog
2) In Increments enter the number of shapes between the two objects.
3) Select Cross-fading attributes  to apply a gradual change of line and fill properties 
between the two objects.
4) Select Same orientation to apply a smooth transition between the two objects.
5) Click OK to carry out the cross-fading and close the Cross-fading dialog.
Grouping and combining multiple objects
Using Draw, a group of objects can be grouped together allowing multiple objects to be treated 
as one object, or combined together to create a new shape, as shown by the example (1) in 
Figure 229. For more information on grouping and combining objects, see the LibreOffice Draw 
Guide.
Figure 229: Example of grouping and combining objects
Grouping
Grouping of objects is similar to putting objects into a container. The objects can be moved as a 
group and global changes applied to the objects within the group. A group can always be undone  
(ungroup). Objects that make up a group can always be manipulated separately and retain their 
own individual properties.
Temporary grouping
A temporary grouping is when several objects are selected using one of the following methods:
• While holding down the Shift key, click on each object with the cursor to select it for the  
temporary group.
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 275• Click and drag the cursor to create a rectangle (also known as a marquee) around the 
objects required for the temporary group.
Any changes to object parameters carried out are applied to all of the objects within the 
temporary group. For example, rotating a temporary group of objects in its entirety.
To cancel a temporary grouping of objects, click outside of the selection handles displayed 
around the objects.
Permanent grouping
A permanent grouping of objects can be created after selecting objects using one of the 
following methods:
• Go to Shape > Group > Group  on the Menu bar.
• Right-click on the selected objects and select Group in the context menu.
• Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G (macOS ⌘+Shift+G)
When deselected, the objects remain grouped together. Any editing operations carried out on the  
group are applied to all objects within the group. If one object in the group is clicked, the whole 
group is selected.
Editing within groups
Editing an individual within a group can be carried out without ungrouping or breaking the group. 
After selecting the group, use one of the following methods to enter the group:
• Go to Shape > Group > Enter Group  on the Menu bar.
• Right-click on the selected group and select Enter Group in the context menu.
• Use the keyboard shortcut F3.
• Double-click on the selected group.
When editing is finished on an individual object within a group, use one of the following methods 
to exit the group:
• Go to Shape > Group > Exit Group  on the Menu bar.
• Right-click and select Exit Group in the context menu.
• Use the keyboard shortcut Shift+F3 (macOS ⌘+F3).
Ungrouping
To ungroup or break apart a permanent group of objects, use one of the following methods:
• Go to Shape > Group > Ungroup  on the Menu bar.
• Right-click and select Ungroup in the context menu.
• Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+Shift+G  (macOS + ⌥⌘+Shift+G).
Nesting groups
A group of groups, more commonly known as nested groups, can be created. When nested 
groups are created, Draw retains the individual group hierarchy and remembers the order in 
which groups were selected. That is, the last individual group selected will be on top of all the 
other groups within a nested group. Ungrouping and entering a nested group work in the same 
way as for individual groups.
276 |Getting Started 24.8Combining objects
Combining is a permanent merging of objects, creating a new object. The original objects are no 
longer available as individual entities and cannot be edited as individual objects. Any editing of a 
combined object affects all the objects that were used when combination was carried out. For 
more information on combining objects, see the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
After selecting the objects for combining, use one of the following methods to create a new 
object. An example of combining objects is shown in Figure  229 (2) on page 310.
• Go to Shape > Combine  on the Menu bar.
• Right-click on the objects and select Shapes > Combine  in the context menu.
• Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+K (macOS ⌘+Shift+K).
Merging, subtracting, and intersection
After selecting several objects, the Merge, Subtract, and Intersect functions become available. 
These functions are similar to combining objects, but allow the creation of a differently shaped 
object from the selected objects. The shape of the object depends on which function used. See 
the LibreOffice Draw Guide  for more information on how to use these functions.
Arranging, aligning, and distributing objects
In LibreOffice Draw, selected objects can be arranged, aligned, and distributed in relation to 
each other. See the LibreOffice Draw Guide  for more information on arranging and aligning 
objects.
• Arrange the position of an object by moving it either forward or backward in relation to 
the order of objects.
• Align objects with respect to each other using Left, Centered, or Right for horizontal 
alignment and Top, Center, or Bottom for vertical alignment.
• Distribute objects so that the space between each of the objects is the same.
Inserting and exporting images
Inserting
LibreOffice Draw contains a number of functions for editing images (also called pictures, raster 
graphics, or bitmaps). These functions include the import and export of images, and conversion 
from one image format to another. For more information on working with images, see Chapter 5, 
Working with Images and Graphics in this guide and the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
LibreOffice Draw includes a large range of filters so that it can read and display several image 
file formats. It also includes several tools for working with images, but does not have the same 
functionality as specialized programs, for example GIMP, or Adobe Photoshop.
Images can be added from several sources:
• Directly from a scanner ( Insert > Media > Scan  on the Menu bar).
• Created by another program, for example photographs from a digital camera ( Insert > 
Image on the Menu bar).
• The LibreOffice Gallery; see Chapter 5, Working with Images and Graphics.
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 277Exporting
LibreOffice Draw saves images as drawings in the Open Document Format ( odf). To save an 
image or the entire file in another format, go to File > Export on the Menu bar and select a 
format in the drop-down list. The image formats that LibreOffice Draw can export in and save to 
are listed in Appendix B, Open Source, Open Standards, OpenDocument.
LibreOffice Draw files can also be exported in HTML, XHTML, or PDF format. The HTML export 
uses a conversion wizard that creates as many web pages as there are pages in a document. 
Optionally drawing pages can be displayed in frames with a navigator and an index page. For 
more information about file formats, see Chapter 10, Working with File Formats, Security, and 
Exporting.
Working with 3D objects
Although LibreOffice Draw does not match the functionality of specialized drawing, or image 
editing programs, it is capable of producing and editing good 3D drawings. For more information,  
see the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
Create a 3D object in LibreOffice Draw using one of the following methods:
• Select a 3D shape in the 3D Objects panel in the Shapes deck on the Sidebar.
• Right-click on a 2D object and select Convert > To 3D, or To 3D Rotation Object  in the 
context menu.
• Right-click on a 2D object and select Format > 3D Effects on the Menu bar.
Working with layers
Using layers when creating complex drawings makes a drawing easier to navigate and edit. 
Placing a simpler drawing that is part of a complex drawing into its own layer makes editing 
easier. Any area of a layer that does not contain a drawing object is transparent and does not 
obscure any part of a complex drawing. Any number of layers can be added to a drawing. For 
more information on layers, see the LibreOffice Draw Guide .
A drawing in LibreOffice contains three default layers that cannot be deleted or renamed:
• Layout — is the default Workspace where objects are normally placed when a drawing 
is created.
• Controls — used for form controls that have been assigned an action. Objects on this 
layer are always in front of objects on other layers.
• Dimension Lines — is where the dimension lines are drawn. By switching the layer to 
show or hide, dimension lines can be switched on or off.
A layer can be set to one or all of the following attributes:
• Visible or hidden.
• Printable or not printable.
• Locked or unlocked.
To quickly toggle the attributes for a selected layer, use the following keyboard shortcuts:
• Shift+click — toggle between a layer being visible or hidden.
• Ctrl+click (macOS ⌘+click) — toggle between a layer being locked or unlocked.
278 |Getting Started 24.8• Ctrl+Shift+click  (macOS ⌘+Shift+click) — toggle between a layer being printed 
or not printed.
Adding layers
1) Use one of the following methods to open the Insert Layer dialog (Figure  230):
– Go to Insert > Layer on the Menu bar.
– Right-click on the layer tabs at the bottom of the Workspace and select Insert Layer in 
the context menu.
2) Enter a meaningful Name, Title, and Description for the new layer in the text boxes.
3) Select Visible if the layer is to be visible in a drawing. When Visible is not selected, the 
layer is hidden and its name in the layer tab changes color to blue.
4) Select Printable if the layer is to be printed when a drawing is printed. Not printing is 
useful if a draft layer is required for guides or annotations that are used in making a 
drawing, but do not appear in the final output. The name of a layer is underlined in the 
layer tab bar when the Printable option is turned off.
5) Select Locked to prevent any objects on this layer from deletion, editing, or moving. No 
additional objects can be added to a locked layer. Locking a layer is useful, for example, 
when a base plan is to be protected while adding a new layer with other details. The 
name of a locked layer is written in Italics in the layer tab bar.
6) Click OK to create the new layer and close the Insert Layer dialog. A new layer 
automatically becomes active when added to a drawing.
Figure 230: Insert Layer dialog
Note
Layers are added to the drawing in the order that they were inserted. The layer order  
cannot be changed.
Chapter 7,  Getting Started with Draw  | 279Modifying layers
1) To modify a layer, use one of the following methods to open the Modify Layers dialog, 
which is similar in layout and options to the Insert Layers dialog.
– Right-click on the name tab of the layer and select Modify Layer in the context menu.
– Double-click on the layer tab.
– Go to Format > Layer on the Menu bar.
2) Make the required changes to the layer, then click OK to save the changes and close the

Relational databases in LibreOfficeIntroduction
A data source, or database is an organized collection of information that can be accessed or 
managed by software. When you manage a database in LibreOffice, you will do it through the 
Base module. 
For example, a list of names and addresses could be turned into a database that could help you 
create a mail merge letter, or a business stock list could be a data source managed through 
LibreOffice.
Base serves as a database front end that can create and store embedded databases (Figure  
234) or connect to external databases (Figure 235). 
Figure 234: Local database
 Figure 235: Remote database server
This chapter explains how Base can create databases and reads what is contained in a 
database, and it also describes how the different parts of the module are used.
Note
LibreOffice uses the terms “Data Source” and “Database” to refer to the same thing, 
which could be a database such as MySQL or dBase, a spreadsheet or text 
document holding data, or an address book.
Database components explained
Tables
A database consists of a number of fields that contain the individual pieces of data, which  
in turn can be organized in records and then into tables. Unlike Calc spreadsheets, 
database tables cannot have formulas and when creating a table, you also determine the  
characteristics of each field within it (text, characters, integer numbers, floating point 
numbers, binary data, etc…) 
Forms
Forms are documents created for data entry into the fields of one or more tables which 
have been associated with the form. For example, when you enter your data in a web 
284 |Getting Started 24.8service, you are using a form. Forms can also be used for viewing fields from one or 
more tables associated with the form. 
Queries
A query creates a new table from the existing tables. A query extract data from tables 
given a specific search criteria you define.
Reports
A report organizes the information from the fields of a query or table into a formatted 
document according to your requirements.
Caution
Some features of the Base module, such as  the HSQLDB database engine, and the 
ability to create reports) need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The JRE is not 
installed in Base by default. Please go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > 
Advanced to select a JRE from those installed on your computer.
Type of databases in LibreOffice Base
Base can create both flat and relational databases , and it can create databases where fields 
have relationships with each other.
Flat databases
A flat database is a simple database system in which each database is represented as a 
single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data. The table is 
usually stored and physically represented as a simple text file, CSV file or spreadsheet.
Relational databases
A relational database (RDB) is a collective set of multiple data sets organized by tables, 
records and columns (fields). RDBs establish a well-defined relationship between 
database tables. Tables communicate and share information, which facilitates data 
searchability, organization and reporting.Base use Structured Query Language (SQL), a 
standard user application that provides an easy programming interface for database 
interaction.
For example: Consider a database that lists a CD music collection. It will contain fields for the 
names of the artists and a field that holds the CD title. While there is an obvious relationship 
between the artist and the CD they have created, the CD collection may contain more than one 
CD by the same artist. These are one-to-many relationships: many artists are linked to more 
than one CD, so this database contains multiple one-to-many relationships. However, the record 
company database can contain the names of the artist plus other fields like artist agent. The 
relationship between artist and agent is one to one: only one agent for each artist.
Tip
If you are acquainted with mathematical sets, a relational database can easily be 
explained in terms of sets: elements, subsets, unions, and intersections. The fields of 
a database are the elements and the tables are subsets. Relationships within 
databases are defined in terms of unions and intersections of the subsets (tables).
Planning a database
Databases exist to organize data for easy and accurate retrieval. Database tables are much 
stricter to define and create, therefore p lanning in advance is necessary. In this chapter, we will 
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 285show you how to plan a database. In our example, we will create a database that contains 
automobile expenses. 
The first step in creating a database is to define it by determining what fields are needed. In this 
case, we will ask a series of questions about the data:
What are the user output requirements?
Information is needed on three broad areas: fuel usage, maintenance, and vacation.
What input data is required for the output?
Fuel purchases, maintenance expenses, and vacation expenses.
What fields fit the fuel purchases area?
Date purchased, odometer reading, fuel cost, fuel quantity, and payment method for it. 
(Fuel economy need not be included, as it can be calculated using a query.)
What fields fit the maintenance area?
Date of service, odometer reading, type of service, cost of service, and next scheduled 
service of this type (for example, for oil changes, list when the next oil change should 
be). A field for notes was added to the list.
What fields fit the vacations area?
Date, odometer reading, fuel (including all the fields of the fuel table), food (including 
meals and snacks), motel, total tolls, and miscellaneous. These purchases are made by 
one of two bank cards or cash, so we will need a field to state which payment type was 
used for each item.
What fields fit into the food category?
Breakfast, lunch, supper, and snacks seem to fit. Should all the snacks be listed 
individually or list the total cost for snacks for the day? In this case, the snacks are 
divided into two fields: number of snacks and total cost of snacks, and a payment type is 
also needed for breakfast, lunch, supper, and total cost of snacks.
What are the fields that are common to more than one area?
Date appears in multiple areas, as does odometer reading and payment type.
How will these fields be used to get the required information?
While on vacation, the expenses for each day will be listed together. These date fields 
suggest a relationship between the vacation table and the dates in the fuel and food 
tables, so the date fields in these tables will be linked when the database is created.
These payment type will include two bank cards and cash. So a table will be created with  
a field for the type of payment and use it in list boxes in the forms.
Tip
After the fields for the database tables have been listed, we will need a field for the 
primary key, which is an identifier that is unique to each record. Some of the tables 
already have a suitable field for the primary key but an additional field for the primary  
key must be created for other fields (like payment type).
If a table does not have a primary key field, any data that is added, deleted, or 
modified must be done with the Execute SQL Statement dialog ( Tools > SQL…).
286 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 236: LibreOffice Base window
Using the Database Wizard to create a new database
To create a new database, you should start with the Database Wizard. The wizard can be started  
by doing one of the following:
• Selecting File > New > Database  on the Menu bar
• Clicking the arrow next to the New icon on the Standard toolbar and selecting Database 
in the drop-down menu.
• Clicking the Base Database button in the Create area of the LibreOffice Start Center.
• If you are already working in Base, you can also press Ctrl+N. 
Once the Wizard is started, the first page of the wizard appears (Figure 237). Select the 
HSQLDB Embedded  entry is selected in the Embedded database  drop-down menu, select 
Create a new database , then click Next. (Look at the Base Guide for information about using 
alternative embedded database engines or existing external databases). 
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 287Figure 237: Creating a new database
Next, the second page of the Database Wizard appears (Figure 238) with two questions. For the  
first question, make sure the database is registered. And for the second question, click the Open 
the database for editing checkbox . Click Finish. The Database Wizard will prompt you to 
select a location to name and save the database.
Figure 238: Registering the new database
Note
To open and close the Data Sources window that contains the list of registered 
databases Writer and Calc, select View > Data Sources  or press Ctrl+Shift+F4. If 
a database is not registered, they will not appear in this window. and you cannot 
access it in Writer or Calc if you need to use data from it.
Save this new database with the name Automobile and the Automobile.odb – LibreOffice Base 
window appears (Figure 236).
Tip
Every time the Automobile database is opened, the Automobile.odb – LibreOffice 
Base window opens. Changes can then be made to the database. The title for this 
window is always <database name> – LibreOffice Base.
288 |Getting Started 24.8Caution
When you create a database, you should save your work regularly. This means you 
should save the whole database as well.
For example, when you create your first table, you must save it before you can close 
it. This makes it part of the database in memory. But only when you save the 
database file that the table is written to disk.
Note
All database files in Open Document Format are stored with the *.odb extension. 
Files in that format contain all elements of the database, including forms, reports, 
tables, and the data itself. The same format can also store a connection to an 
external database server instead of the local data, for example, to access a MySQL 
or PostgreSQL database server in your network.
Creating database tables
Database tables store information in a group of things called fields. For example, a table will use 
fields to hold the data in an address book, a stock list, a phone book, or a price list. A database 
must have at least one table and will probably have have multiple tables.
Each field can hold data of a single type. For example, an address book that contains phone 
numbers would contain phone numbers in fields that are the Phone type. Similarly, a price list 
table might contain two fields: Name and Price. The Name field would contain the names of the 
items; the Price field would contain the amount of each item.
To work with tables, click the Tables icon in the Database list, select View > Tables, or press 
Alt+A. The tasks that you can perform on a table are in the Tasks list (see Figure 325).
Using the Table Wizard to create a table
This Base wizard  allows you to create two types of tables: business and personal. Each 
category contains sample tables from which to choose. Each table has a list of available fields.
The Table Wizard provides sample tables as a starting point to create your own table.
Click Use Wizard to Create Table . This opens the Table Wizard (Figure  240).
Figure 239: Creating a table using Wizard
Step 1: Select fields
First, we will use the wizard to generate a table in the Personal category. We will borrow a table 
from the supplied CD-Collection:
1) Category: Select Personal and a list of sample tables for personal use appears.
2) Sample tables: Select CD-Collection and  a list of available fields appears in the 
Selected fields window..
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 2893) Selected fields: By selecting each field and using the > button, move the following fields 
from the Available fields list to the Selected fields list: CollectionID, AlbumTitle, Artist, 
DatePurchased, Format, Notes, and NumberofTracks.
Figure 240: Selecting fields from the Personal category
Next, we will use the wizard to create a table from the Business category:
1) Category: Select Business as the Category. Select Employees in the drop-down list of 
sample tables. 
Figure 241: Selecting fields for the table
290 |Getting Started 24.82) Use the > button to move the Photo field from the Available fields list to the Selected 
fields list. It will be at the bottom of the list, directly below the NumberofTracks field. If you  
make a mistake in selecting fields, click on the field name in the Selected fields list and 
use the < button to move it from the Selected fields list back to the Available fields list.
3) If necessary,  click the field name  and use the up and down arrows on the right side of 
the Selected fields list to move it to the correct position.
4) Click Next.
Tip
You can double-click on a field to transfer it from from the Available fields list  the 
Selected fields list or  double-click a field in the Selected fields list to transfer it back 
to the Available fields list.
Step 2: Set field types and formats
Once the wizard has helped you to select the fields for your database, it will allow you to assign 
properties to each field. (See Figure 243.) In this example, set each field’s properties as follows:
Note
If any of these fields requires a mandatory entry, set Entry required to Yes. A blank 
field will then not be allowed. By default, the Entry required property is set to No. 
(Because AutoValue has been set to Yes. Figure 243 does not display the Entry 
required field.)
• CollectionID: Since this field must be filled, change AutoValue from No to Yes. 
• AlbumTitle:
– Entry required: If all of your music is in album format, set Entry required as Yes. If not, 
set this property to No.
– Length: Do not change this property unless you have titles that exceed 100 characters 
counting the spaces.
• Artist: Set Entry Required to Yes unless you do not always use this field.
• Date Purchased: Field type: default setting. In this case, Entry required should be No 
unless you want to add this information to all database entries.
• Format: Change the Entry Required setting from No to Yes.
• Notes: No changes are required.
• NumberofTracks: Change the Field type to Small Integer [ SMALLINT ] , which allows 
for 32768 tracks.
• Photo: Use the default settings.
Note
Since Base requires you to specify the maximum length of each field on creation, 
make sure you make each field as large or maybe larger than necessary. By default, 
Base uses the VARCHAR format for a text field, so it will only use the number of 
characters necessary for the field even if it takes up less space than than the limit. 
So when a field uses VARCHAR, a field that contains 20 characters will only take up 
20 characters in the database, even if the limit for the field is set at 100. In contrast, 
a text field with the CHAR text format has a fixed length and that field will be 100 
characters long even if the actual length is 1 or 100.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 291Note
Each field has a Field type, which must be specified. Types include text, integer, 
date, and decimal. If the field is going to have general information in it (for example, 
a name or a description), use text. If the field will always contain a number (for 
example, a price), the type should be decimal or another numerical field. The wizard 
picks the right field type, so to get an idea of how this works, see what the wizard 
has chosen for different fields.
Tip
Since up and down arrows are available on this page (not shown in Figure 243), you 
can use these to reorder the list of fields. Also + and – buttons are available and you 
can use these to remove fields from the list or to add new fields.
When you have finished, click Next.
Step 3: Set primary key
1) In this example, Create a primary key  should be checked.
2) Next, select option Use an existing field as a primary key .
3) In the Fieldname drop-down list, select CollectionID.
4) Select Auto value if it is not already checked. Click Next.
Note
A  primary key field contains a unique number that can be used to identify a specific 
entry in a database. In this case, CollectionID will contain a number that is assigned 
automatically by Base to each record of this table.
Step 4: Create table
1) At this point, the wizard will allow you to rename the table. For this example, make no 
changes.
2) Leave the option Insert data immediately  checked.
3) Click Finish to complete the Table Wizard. Close the Table Data View window created by  
the Table Wizard. You are now back to the main window of the database, but a table 
named CD-Collection is now listed in the Tables portion of the window.
4) Click the Save button on the Standard toolbar at the top of the main window.
Creating a table by copying an existing table
If you want to create identical tables for each type of music you have, you can make copies of 
the original table and name each according to the type of music contained in it.
1) Click on the Tables icon in the Database area of the LibreOffice Base window to see the 
existing tables.
2) Right-click on the CD-Collection table icon. Choose Copy in the context menu.
3) Right-click, and select Paste. The Copy table dialog opens.
4) Change the Table name to CD-Jazz, and set Options to Definition and data  and click 
Create.
292 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 242: Creating copies of original table 
Tip
The action buttons on this page allow you to move selected fields, or all fields, in 
either direction. You can also double-click to move a field from one list to the other.
5) Click the Save button on the Standard toolbar at the top of the LibreOffice Base window.
Caution
After a table has been created in Base and data has been entered, the field 
properties cannot be changed. Before you create a table, make sure you have 
decided the correct names, length, and format for each field.
As a result, deleting a field deletes all the data once contained in that field. 
Changing the field type of a field after the table has been created can lead to data 
being lost either partially or completely. 
Deleting a table removes all of the data contained in every field of the table. As a 
result, do not delete a table unless you are certain.
6) Double-click on the CD-Jazz table icon and visually verify the data before closing the 
table
7) Right-click on the CD-Jazz table icon, select Delete and confirm deletion.
Creating Tables in Design View
Once you are familiar with creating a table with the Wizard, use Design View to create a new 
table. View allows you to directly enter information about each field in a table. We will use this 
method for the next example (the Automobile database).
Note
While the field types and formatting are different in Design View, the process is 
similar to the one used in the Table Wizard.
When we create the Automobile database, the first table we will generate is Fuel. Its fields will 
be FuelID, Date, FuelCost, FuelQuantity, Odometer, and PaymentType.
1) Find the Tasks area of the LibreOffice Base window and click Create Table in Design 
View to open LibreOffice’s Base: Table Design dialog.
2) Enter FuelID into the Field Name field then press Tab key to move to the Field Type 
column. Select Integer [INTEGER]  from its drop-down field. 
Tip
You can select fields from the Field Type drop-down list by pressing the key for the 
first letter of the choice. You can cycle through the choices for a given letter by 
repeatedly pressing that key.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 293d) Change the Field Properties in the bottom section of the dialog for FuelID.
Change AutoValue from No to Yes.
e) Set FuelID as the primary key for the Automobile database.
Click in the Field Name cell directly below FuelID. The dialog automatically sets FuelID 
as the primary key and places a key icon in front of FuelID (Figure 244)
.
 Figure 243: Changing field types
Figure 244: Defining the primary key field
Tip
When you assign certain integer field types (Integer and BigInt for example) to a 
field, selecting Yes for AutoValue automatically makes that field the primary key.
Primary keys for any other field type must be selected by right-clicking the rectangle 
before the field and selecting Primary Key in the context menu.
Note
The primary key serves as a unique ID for each record in a database. You can use 
any name for this field. We have used FuelID for convenience, so we know to what 
function it serves.
294 |Getting Started 24.83) When you are creating the Date, FuelCost, FuelQuantity, Odometer, and PaymentType 
fields, do the following:
a) Type the field name in the Field Name column.
b) Select the field type:
– For Date use Date[DATE]. (Press the D key to select it.)
– FuelCost, FuelQuantity, and Odometer use Number [NUMERIC] . (Press the N key 
once to select it.)
– PaymentType uses Text [VARCHAR], the default setting.
c) FuelCost, FuelQuantity, and Odometer also need changes in the Field Properties 
section (Figure 245).
– FuelCost: Change the Length to 5 and Decimal places to 2. Click Format Field (Figure 
245). This opens the Field Format dialog (Figure 246). Use Currency as the Category 
and your currency as the Format.
Figure 245: Changing field properties
– FuelQuantity: Change Length to 6 and Decimal places to 3. (Many fuel pumps 
measure fuel to thousandths of a gallon in the USA.) 
– Odometer: Change the Length to 10 and the Decimal places to 1.
d) Repeat steps a) through c) until you have entered all of the fields.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 295Figure 246: Format example options
4) To save and close the table in the Table Design dialog, select File > Save, or click the 
Save icon on the Standard toolbar, or press Ctrl+S. Name the table Fuel.
5) Close the Table Design dialog.
6) In the main database window, select File > Save, click the Save icon on the Standard 
toolbar, or Ctrl+S to save the database.
Follow the same steps to create the Vacations table. The fields, field types, and descriptions are 
listed in Figure 247.
7) Make the following changes in the Field Properties area of the window.
a) Odometer: As described in step 3)), bullet c)) for the corresponding field of the Fuel 
table.
b) Motel, Tolls, Breakfast, Lunch, Supper, SnCost, and Miscellaneous: Format currency 
the same as step 3)), bullet c)) for the FuelCost field of the Fuel table.
8) Making Date the primary key in this table has to be done in a different way because this 
field is typed as Date, not Integer.
a) Right-click to the left of the field name Date.
b) Select Primary Key in the context menu.
Following similar steps to those above, you should use Design View to create a much simpler 
table entitled Payment Type. This table contains two fields, named Type, with the field type set to  
Text [ VARCHAR ] and PaymentID (field type Integer [ INTEGER ] ). Set the PaymentID field as 
the primary key for the table.
296 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 247: Fields in Vacations table
Defining relationships
Now that the tables have been created for the Automobile database, what are the relationships 
between these database tables? 
When on vacation, you will want to enter all of your expenses at once each day. Most of these 
expenses are in the Vacations table, but the fuel we buy is not. So we will link these two tables 
using the Date fields. Since the Fuel table may have more than one entry per date, this 
relationship between the Vacations and Fuel tables is one to many (it is designated 1:n).
1) Make sure you are still in the Automobile database and select Tools > Relationships . 
The Automobile – LibreOffice Base: Relation Design window opens and the Add Tables 
dialog pops up. (You can also open it by clicking the Add Tables icon on the Relation 
Design window if you ever need to do so.)
Figure 248: Designation for a 1:n relationship
2) Once the Add Tables dialog is active, use one of two ways to add a table to the Relation 
Design window:
– Double-click the name of the table. In our case, do this for both Vacations and Fuel.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 297– Or, for each table, click the name of the table and then click Add.
3) When you have added the tables you want, click Close to close the Add Tables dialog.
4) Next, define the relationship between the Vacations and Fuel tables by clicking the New 
Relation icon on the Standard toolbar or selecting the Insert > New Relation  command. 
Either command opens the Relations dialog (Figure 249). Our two tables are listed in the 
Tables Involved section.
Figure 249: Selected fields in a relationship
a) In the Fields Involved section, click the drop-down list under the Fuel label.
b) Select Date in the list.
c) Click in the cell to the right of this drop-down list. This opens a drop-down list for the 
Vacations table.
d) Select Date in the list. It should now look like Figure 249.
e) Modify the Update Options and Delete Options section of the Relations dialog 
(Figure 250).
Figure 250: Update Options and Delete Options section
– Select Update cascade in the Update options area.
– Select Delete cascade in the Delete options area.
f) Click OK.
g) In the Relation Design dialog, click the Save icon or select File > Save.
h) Close the Relation Design dialog.
i) Click the Save button on the Standard toolbar at the top of the main database window.
Tip
The primary key can contain more than one field. (Its foreign key1 will contain the 
same number of fields.) If this were the case in Figure 249, the other fields of the 
1A field in a table that stores values of the primary key of records in another table.
298 |Getting Started 24.8primary field for the Fuel table would be listed under Date. The corresponding fields 
of the foreign key would be listed under Vacations. Detailed information about this is 
in the Base Guide.
While these options are not strictly necessary, they do help. Having them selected permits you to  
update a table that has a relationship defined with another table which has been modified. It also  
permits you to delete a field from the table without causing inconsistencies.
Creating a database form
Once you have created a database to store data, you will need a form. In the language of 
databases, a form is a front end for data entry and editing.
A simple form should include all of the fields from a table (Figure 251). More complex forms can 
contain much more, including additional text, graphics, selection boxes, and many other 
elements. Figure 252 is made from the same table with a text label (Fuel Purchases), a list box 
placed in PaymentType, and a graphic background.
Tip
A list box is useful when a field contains a fixed number of options. It saves you from 
having to type data by hand and having to double-check that the entered data is 
correct, and ensures that invalid options are not entered.
Figure 251: Fields of a simple form
 Figure 252: Simple form with additions
In our database, payments for food or fuel might be made from one of two credit cards (Dan or 
Kevin) or in cash, so these would be the available options for all boxes that contain payments.
Note
To create a list box as in Figure 252, we first need to create a small, separate table 
containing the name of the options. Then use the contents of the table to fill the list 
box. See Modifying a form below
Creating a form with the Form Wizard
We will use the Form Wizard to create a Vacations form, which will contain a form and a 
subform.
In the main database window (Figure 236), activate the Form Wizard by clicking the Forms icon 
in the Database area, selecting View > Forms, or pressing Alt+M. You can also click Use 
Wizard to Create Form  on the Tasks list to open the Form Wizard (Figure 253). When the Form 
Wizard is activated, it displays the Database Form window and the Form Wizard dialog. 
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 299Figure 253: Selecting fields in the Form Wizard
Step 1: Select fields
1) On the Form Wizard dialog, under Tables or queries drop-down, select Table: 
Vacations. The Available fields list contains the fields for the Vacations table.
2) Move all of these fields to the Fields in the form list by selecting each field and clicking 
the  >> button. Click Next.
Tip
Using the four action buttons in the center of this page, you can move selected 
fields, or all fields, in either direction. You can also double-click to move a field from 
one list to the other. The up and down arrows on the right can be used to re-order 
entries in the Fields in the form list.
Step 2: Set up a subform
Since we have already created a relationship between the Fuel and Vacations tables, we will use  
that relationship. If no relationship had been defined, you would have to do it later in the wizard 
(Step 4: Get joined fields ).
1) Click the box labeled Add Subform.
2) Click the Subform based upon existing relation radio buttons .
3) Fuel is listed as a relation we want to add. So click Fuel to highlight it, as in Figure 254. 
Click Next.
Figure 254: Adding a subform
300 |Getting Started 24.8Step 3: Add subform fields
This step is similar to Step 1: Select fields , but not all the fields will be used in the subform.
1) Fuel is preselected under Tables or queries.
2) Use the >> button to move all the fields to the Fields in the form list.
3) Click the FuelID field to highlight it.
4) Use the < button to move the FuelID back to the Available fields list (Figure 255).
5) Click Next.
Figure 255: Selecting fields for a subform
Step 4: Get joined fields
This step is for tables or queries for which no relationship has been defined. Because the 
relationship has been defined in this example, the wizard will skip this step.
Note
Relationships between two tables can be based upon more than one pair of fields. 
For more information on this, consult the Base Guide.
Caution
When creating a relationship between fields from two tables, those fields have to 
have the same field type. That is why we used the Date field from both tables: both 
their field types are Date [ DATE ].
Whether a single pair of fields from two tables are chosen as the relationship, or two 
or more pairs are chosen, certain requirements must be met for the form to work.
– One of the fields from the main form must be the primary key for its table. (Date would 
have to be used.)
– No field from the subform can be the primary key for its table. ( FuelID cannot be used.)
– Each pair of joined fields must have the same field type.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 301Step 5: Arrange controls
A form’s control consists of two parts: label and field. In this step, you determine where a 
control’s label and field are placed relative to each other. From left to right, you can choose 
Columnar – Labels Left , Columnar – Labels on Top , As Data Sheet, and In Blocks – Labels 
Above.
1) In this example, we will arrange the main form  by clicking the second icon ( Columnar – 
Labels on Top). The labels will be placed above the related field.
2) Next, we will arrange the subform by  clicking the third icon ( As Data Sheet). The labels 
are column headings and the field entries are in spreadsheet format. Click Next.
Figure 256: Arrange controls
Step 6: Set data entry
In this example, accept the default settings and click Next.
Step 7: Apply styles
1) Select the color you want in the Apply styles list. In this example, use the Beige option.
2) Select the Field border you want. In this example, use the 3D look option. You might 
want to try different settings.
3) Click Next.
Step 8: Set name
1) Enter the name for the form. Use Vacations.
2) Click Modify the form.
3) Click Finish. The form opens in edit mode, Base will display the Fuel – LibreOffice Base:  
Database Form window.
Modifying a form
When a form is generated with the Wizard (Figure 257), it usually needs to be reformatted. 
Figure 257 is not organized at all. Every control seems to have a different size and the color 
needs to be changed.
302 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 257: Basic form created using Wizard
These controls are different sizes because they contain different types of field data. Since Base 
has three types of controls (text, formatted, and date), these fields are formatted differently. The 
width of text controls is designed to display a large number of characters, while formatted 
controls  are shorter because they will usually contain numbers or decimals. Date controls are 
fairly short, except for the date formats is day of the week, month, day, year (Thursday, October 
31, 2020), which requires a larger width than 10/31/2020 or 31/10/2020.
First, we will modify the payment type controls. These fields need to be replaced with a list box, 
and each list box will be related to an existing field in the table, Payment Type.
Note
The following steps assume that the PaymentType table already contains three 
single-field records. These might be Cash, Dan, and Kevin. If necessary, you could 
use the Form Wizard to create a very simple form to input or edit these values.
Next, we will carry out the following steps:
1) Replace fields with list boxes.
2) Modify text controls (label field first and then the data field).
3) Modify the date control.
4) Modify formatted controls.
5) Modify fields in the table.
6) Group the controls (food, fuel subform, and miscellaneous).
7) Modify the memo control.
8) Add headings (for each group in the form).
9) Change the background to a picture, then modify some of the labels so that they can be 
read clearly against this background. Change the font color of the headings.
10) Change tab order of fields.
Figure 258 shows a section of the Form Design toolbar and key icons are identified that will be 
used during the following steps. Figure 266 shows the Form Navigator.

Figure 265: Navigation arrows of a form
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 305Figure 266: Form Navigator
Step 1): Replace fields with list boxes
1) Open the Control Properties and Form Navigator dialogs and click the Control 
Properties and Form Navigator icons. (You may need to select a control to make the 
Control Properties  icon available)
2) Open the Form Navigator and click the first text box whose name contains the word 
“Payment”.
3) If both the label and text box components of the field are highlighted in the Form 
Navigator, double-click the text box so that only it is highlighted.
Tip
If the Form Navigator does not have the input focus, selecting a field highlights both 
field components (for example, label and text). If this arises, then double-clicking the 
required component will highlight it, and enable you to subsequently move from one 
component to another with a single click.
4) Right-click the text box in the Form Navigator, right-click to bring up the context menu, 
then select Replace with > List Box .
5) In the Properties dialog, the heading will become Properties: List Box and the General 
tab is selected. Scroll down to the Dropdown property and change No to Yes.
6) Select the Data tab.
7) Go to Type of list contents . Change Valuelist to Sql.
8) The line below this becomes List content. Click the ellipsis (…) to the right of this 
property to open the SQL Command – LibreOffice Base: Query Design window and the 
Add Table or Query dialog. 
9) The PaymentType table has the required entries. Click it, and then click the Add button.
10) Close the Add Table or Query dialog.
11) In the SQL Command – LibreOffice Base: Query Design window, double-click Type in 
the table named PaymentType. This places Type in the Field row of the tabular area.
306 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 267: Selecting PaymentType
12) Save and close this window. The SQL code appears in the List content property. (SELECT 
"Type" FROM "PaymentType" )
13) Change the Bound field value from 1 to 0. 
14) Repeat these steps for each field containing the word “Payment”, six fields in total. (See 
Note below before doing this.)
Tip
There are times, as in this example, when 8)) through12) ) produces the same SQL 
code. When this happens, copy the code. Paste the code into the Type of list 
contents property before doing 13)). It is a nice shortcut.
Step 2): Modifying text controls
1) In this step, you will modify the text labels and fields to make them more meaningful.
a) Locate the topmost text control in the Form Navigator.
b) Select the associated control label (begins with lbl). The title of the Properties dialog 
should have become Label Field.
c) Click the General tab if it is not already selected.
d) Click the down-arrow at the right end of the Label property to open the drop-down. 
Only then rename the label to Payment Type and press Enter.
e) Click on another property to save this change.
f) Adjust the width of the label field if necessary for the new width of the label name.
g) Repeat a)) through f)) for each label field in the form that contains the word Payment.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 307Note
Base allows you to paste the title of a control in multiple control fields. Once the 
control title Payment Type has been entered for the first time, it can be copied.  For 
the next label, highlight the current label name, paste the name you want, and click 
another property.
2) Resize the fields.
a) Make sure that you are in the edit mode and have opened the Form Navigator and 
Properties dialogs.
b) In the Form Navigator dialog, click the field whose size you want to change.
c) Scroll down to the Width property in the Properties dialog.
d) Estimate the width required based on the set of possible values for this field and 
change the Width property to that value. In the case of our Payment Type fields, the 
text box should be wide enough for the longest possible payment type value of 
“Kevin”.
Figure 268: Modifying listbox properties
e) Click either the PositionY or the Height property to save the change. Also, clicking on 
any other property will do the same thing.
f) Use these same steps to change the size for each of the remaining text controls, 
including txtSnackNo and all the payment type fields.
Step 3): Modify date control
1) With the Properties and Form Navigator dialogs open, select the datDate field in the 
Form Navigator dialog. The heading of the Properties dialog changes to Properties: Date  
Field.
2) In the General tab of the Properties dialog, scroll down to the Date format drop-down list, 
and select the date format you desire. 
3) Scroll down to the Dropdown property and select Yes.
4) Is the width of the Date field inappropriate for the selected format? If so:
308 |Getting Started 24.8a) The Date field has a border around it.
b) Move the cursor over the middle green marker on the right side of the Date field. It 
should become a horizontal double arrow. Drag this to the right to increase the width. 
Drag it to the left to reduce the width. (It may take several attempts to get this right.)
Step 4): Modify formatted controls
Next, make a list of the formatted fields and their labels in the Form Navigator. The fields 
have the fmt prefix. (There are eight of them.)
One of these fields, Odometer, contains the odometer readings as integers. The rest are 
currency fields. 
Perform the following tasks with each field:
1) Revise the label of the control so it has the proper annotation. In the case of lblSnCost, 
change it to Snack Cost.
2) Click the label of the control to be modified in the Form Navigator. If the border for the 
label is longer or shorter than the text in the label, adjust its width as described for the 
Date field above.
3) Click this formatted field in the Form Navigator list.
a) Under the General tab, scroll down to the Formatting property.
b) Click the ellipsis (…) on the right to open the Format Number dialog.
c) For the Odometer field click Number in the Category list, otherwise click Currency.
d) Under Format, select a field.
e) Select the desired number of decimal places (one for Odometer, two otherwise).
f) Select the desired number of leading zeros.
g) Negative numbers red : check if yes, remove the check if no.
h) Thousands separator : check if yes, remove check if no.
i) Click OK.
j) If the width of the field is not correct for the selected format, adjust its width as 
described for the Date field above.
4) Repeat these steps for each field name in the Form Navigator that begins with fmt.
Step 5): Modify fields in the table
The labels in the controls are in the column headings and the values of the field are in 
the column. The Form Navigator does not show any information about them. So 
modifications must be done using the Properties dialog.
The controls in the table control must be modified. To change things, access that particular 
control’s properties by clicking the header.
1) Click the Date label (select the column named Date).
a) Scroll to the Date format property and select the format you desire from the drop-down  
list, if that format differs from the default setting.
b) Scroll to the Width property. Adjust the width if necessary.
c) Scroll to the Dropdown property. If you want to have a small calendar pop-up window, 
select Yes.
2) Click the FuelCost label.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 309a) Open the drop-down list for the Label property. Add a space between Fuel and Cost 
then press Enter.
b) Scroll to the Formatting property. Click the ellipsis (…) on the right. Select Currency 
from the Category column. Uncheck the Negative numbers red  and the Thousands 
separator. Click OK.
c) Scroll to the Width property. Adjust the width if necessary.
d) Change the Alignment property if you do not want data to be to the left. Select Center 
to put the data in the middle of the cell.
3) Click the FuelQuantity label.
a) Open the drop-down list for the Label property. Add a space between Fuel and 
Quantity. Press Enter.
b) Scroll to the Formatting property and change to show three decimal places if needed.
c) Scroll to the Width property. Adjust the width if necessary.
d) Change the Alignment property if you do not want data to be to the left. Select Center 
to put the data in the middle of the cell.
4) Click the Odometer label.
a) Scroll to the Formatting property. If you wish to show one decimal place, make the 
change.
b) Scroll to the Width property. Adjust the width if necessary.
c) If you do not want data to be to the left, change the Alignment property and if you want  
to put the data in the middle of the cell, select Center.
5) Click the PaymentType label.
a) Right-click this label, then add a list box in a context menu by selecting Replace with 
> List Box.
b) Open the drop-down list for the Label property. Add a space between Payment and 
Type. Press Enter.
c) On the Data tab, change the Type of list contents  property to Sql.
d) Paste the SQL code SELECT "Type" FROM "PaymentType"  into the List content 
property. (This is a shortcut method – see the Tip on page 343 and the detailed 
instructions above it if you want more details).
Step 6): Group the controls:
This is a suggested layout which looks reasonably well organized. Use this one or create  
one that appeals to you. The controls may be wider or narrower than yours because of 
the content that will be in them. Note that this layout has left space for the additional 
labels that will be added later.
1) Three icons need to be activated on the Form Design toolbar: Display Grid, Snap to 
Grid, and Helplines While Moving . If this toolbar is on the side of the form, click the 
double arrow (») to open a sub toolbar showing them. If the toolbar is on the top or 
bottom of the form, they are on the right end of it. If there is a double arrow at the end, 
click it to reveal them. Make sure they are highlighted as in this figure.
Figure 269: Help for moving controls
310 |Getting Started 24.82) Some of the controls need to be moved in pairs so the Form Navigator needs to remain 
open. Close the Properties dialog now.
Tip
You can also control the Display Grid, Snap to Grid, and Helplines While Moving  
options using the View > Grid and Helplines  menu.
Note
When moving a control, do not use the PositionX and PositionY properties to place 
the control, because this will place the control’s label and field on top of each other. 
Those properties can move a label or field to a specific location, but are not designed  
to move a control. Use the Position and Size  icon on the Form Design toolbar to 
move a control or group of selected controls.
The list in the Form Navigator reveals which controls needed to be grouped based upon their 
names:
– lblMotel / fmtMotel with lblMPayment / txtMPayment;
– lblBreakfast / fmtBreakfast with lblBPayment / txtBPayment;
– lblLunch / fmtLunch with lblLPayment / txtLPayment;
– lblSupper / fmtSupper with lblSPayment / txtSPayment;
– lblSnackNo / txtSnackNo with lblSnCost / fmtSnCost and with lblSnPayment / 
txtSnPayment (group these three controls together);
– lblMiscellaneous / fmtMiscellaneous with lblMiscPayment / txtMiscPayment.
That is six groups of controls; each one will be moved separately.
The layout shows where each control of a group goes for each of these groups. For most of 
them, the first control holds the cost, and the second contains the payment type in a row. The 
Snacks places the number of snacks followed by the cost and then the payment type. The 
Miscellaneous controls contains the payment below the cost.
1) Before you move an entire group to a new location, move the controls within the group to  
where you want them to be relative to each other.
a) Click on the first control, placing a border around it.
b) Place the mouse pointer over the label or field where it changes its shape.
c) Drag it to an open area of the form.
d) Using the same method, move the second control to the correct position relative to the  
first control.
e) As soon as you begin to move it, the helplines will appear. Use them to line up the 
edges of the controls before releasing the mouse button.
f) If there is a third control, move it to the correct position relative to the second one.
2) Move the controls for the group to where you want them:
a) Click the first component in the Form Navigator list.
b) Use the standard Control+Click and Shift+Click mechanisms until all of the 
labels and fields in this group are highlighted.
c) Place the mouse pointer over one of the labels or fields changing the arrow.
d) Drag the group to where you want its controls to be.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 3113) Repeat for the other controls using these same steps. If a group is going to be below 
another group of controls, use the helplines to line up the left end of the two groups (for 
example: first control under left control).
Figure 270: Form suggested layout
Step 7): Modify memo control
The size of the Note control allows it to be moved to a place that permits the controls of 
the form to be organized without changing the size of the Note control. If the size needed  
modification, this is done using the same methods as for other text controls.
The other modification is adding scrollbars. The choices are none, vertical, horizontal, or both.
1) To change the size of this control, follow the same steps for changing the size for any 
text control.
2) If necessary, move the control to the required position using the same steps described 
above for grouping the controls (Step 6)).
3) Click the Control Properties  icon on the Form Design toolbar if the Properties dialog is 
not open.
4) Select the txtNotes control in the Form Navigator dialog.
5) On the Properties dialog, click the General tab if it is not selected.
6) Scroll down to the Text type property.
7) Select the Multi-line option in its drop-down list.
8) Scroll down to the Scrollbars property.
312 |Getting Started 24.89) In its drop-down list, select the option you need ( None, Vertical, Horizontal, or Both).
10) Close the Properties dialog.
Figure 271: Scroll bar selections in the Properties dialog
Step 8): Add headings
This task is easier to complete if you have end-of-paragraph markers visible. You should 
turn them on by selecting View > Formatting Marks , clicking the Toggle Formatting 
Marks icon on the Standard toolbar, or by pressing Ctrl+F10.
1) Make sure that the cursor is in the top left hand corner of the Database Form window.
2) Move the cursor with the Enter key until it aligns with the gap between the Date field 
and the Breakfast field.
3) Select the Heading 2 style from the Set Paragraph Style  drop-down list.
4) Place the input cursor where the first heading should be. Enter the heading Meals.
5) Move the input cursor with the space bar to the location where the second heading will 
appear. Type the heading Snacks.
6) Press the Enter key repeatedly to move the cursor down until it aligns with the gap 
between the Supper field and the table.
7) If the style has changed, use the Set Paragraph Style  drop-down list on the Formatting 
toolbar to reselect the Heading 2 style.
8) Move the input cursor  to the position where you want the table heading to appear. Type 
the heading Fuel Data.
Tip
The Styles deck can be opened by selecting View > Styles or by pressing F11. Also, 
you can quickly modify the appearance of all three headings by right-clicking the 
Heading 2 style and selecting the Modify option in the context menu would allow. 
See the Writer Guide for details.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 313Step 9): Change the background
The background for a form can be a color or an image. Select a color from the color 
palette at Tools > Options > LibreOffice > Application Colors  or create a custom color  
from the RGB fields.
To add a color to the form background:
1) Right-click the form and select Page Style in the context menu.
2) The Page Style dialog (Figure 272) will appear. Make sure the Area tab is selected.
Figure 272: Page Style dialog
3) Select Color in the row of buttons near the top of the tab.
4) Select a color from the grid. If you wish to access more choices, choose a palette from 
the Palette drop-down menu or use the RGB or Hex boxes to create a specific color or 
click Pick for even more choices.
5) Click Apply to see what your selection will look like in your form.
6) Change if necessary.
7) Click OK to accept your color choice and close the dialog.
To add other form backgrounds:
1) Perform steps 1) and 2) from the previous numbered
2) Select the type of background from the row of buttons: None, Gradient, Bitmap, 
Pattern, or Hatch.
3) In the selected type, choose one of the selections provided or create your own. For 
details, see Chapter 4, Changing Object Attributes, in the Draw Guide.
4) Click Apply to see what your selection will look like in your form.
5) Click OK to accept your choice and close the dialog.
If you selected a bitmap in the list, the form might look like Figure 273.
314 |Getting Started 24.8Step 10): Change the tab order
The Tab key moves the cursor from field to field. This method permits us to group our 
expenses into areas before we begin entering data. For example, all of our meal receipts  
can be grouped together as can our snacks and also our fuel purchases.
Figure 273: Finished form
1) Select View > Toolbar > Form Design  to open the Form Design toolbar.
2) Click the Activation Order icon (circled in Figure 274).
Figure 274: Form Design toolbar with Activation Order icon circled
3) Rearrange the field order in the Tab Order dialog.
a) If you click the Automatic Sort button, Base will automatically generate a tab order.
b) You can use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to change the position of a 
selected control in the list.
c) If necessary, drag a control from one position to another in the Controls list.
d) Define a tab order. If you like, you can put the fields in the same order as Figure 275.
e) Click OK.
4) Save and close the form.
5) Save the database.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 315Figure 275: Possible tab order for the Vacations form
Entering data in a form
Different types of fields allow different methods of data entry. In many cases, more than one data  
entry method can be used.
First, open the form from the main database window (Figure 236).
1) Click the Forms icon in the Database list, or select View > Database, or press Alt+M.
2) Find the form’s name in the Forms list (Vacations).
3) Double-click the form’s name.
The quickest way to enter a date in the Date field is to click on the arrow that opens the drop-
down calendar (Figure 276) and select the day that you want. Then press the Tab key to go to 
the next field.
Figure 276: Calendar drop down
316 |Getting Started 24.8The Odometer, Tolls, and Motel fields are numeric fields. Enter values directly into them, or use 
the up and down arrows (if you chose to display to displace the arrows when the form was 
created). After you have entered a value in a field, use the Tab key to go to the next field.
• To increase the value, click on the up arrow. If you need to decrease the value, click on 
the down arrow.
• The up and down arrows only change the numbers to the left of the decimal place.
• If you need to change numbers to the right of the decimal place, delete them and enter 
the desired numbers.
The Motel’s Payment Type field is a drop-down list. If the elements of the list start with different 
letters, you move to a field by entering the first letter of the field’s title.
• If two or more elements of the list have the same first letter, repeated typing of the first 
letter will cycle through these elements.
• When the selection is correct, use the Tab key to go to the next field.
The form’s remaining fields are either numeric fields or drop-down lists until you reach the Notes 
field (which is a text field). Type anything you desire in this field just as you would any simple text  
editor.
Note
The Tab key is used to move between fields. However, there are some limitations 
where other keys.
Since text fields do not have tab positions, they can not move from one position in 
the field to another one. All spacing must be done by the space bar. 
The Enter key can be used to move between non-text fields, but the function of the 
Enter key in text fields depends upon whether the text field has a single line property.  
If it does, pressing Enter will move the cursor to the next field. But if the text field 
has been assigned a multi-line property, pressing Enter moved will only move the 
cursor down one line. With this field, the Tab key has to be used to move the cursor 
to the next field.
If there was no subform for fuel data, pressing the Tab key in the last field would 
save all of the fields, clear them, and make the form ready to accept data for the next  
record.
Because we have a subform, the Tab key has a different function. It places the cursor in the first 
Date field of the subform with the date automatically entered to match the Date field of the main 
form.
The Fuel Cost, Fuel Quantity, and Odometer fields are numeric fields. The Payment Type field is 
a drop-down list. Enter the data just as you did in the main form, and use the Tab key to go to 
the next field.
When you use the Tab key to leave the Payment Type field, it goes to the Date field of the next 
line and automatically enters the date. Now you can enter your second set of fuel data for this 
day.
When the form has a subform, click any of the fields of the main form to move to another record.  
In this case, click the Date field of the main form. Then use the directional arrows at the bottom. 
Move from left to right: First Record, Previous Record, Next Record, and Last Record (all have 
keyboard shortcuts identified in their extended tips). To the right of these arrows is the New 
Record icon.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 317To create a new record while in the last record of the main form, click either the Next Record 
icon or the New Record icon.
Tip
Each record is numbered and the Record box contains the number of the record 
whose data is shown in the form.
If you need to go to a specific record, enter the record’s number into the record box 
and type Enter to take you to that record.
Figure 277 is a record with data inserted in its fields.
Figure 277: Sample record of the Vacations form and subform
Quickly populate a table with data from a spreadsheet
You can drag and drop a spreadsheet that uses the format for a database table into a database 
table by doing the following:
1) Open the database file in the LibreOffice Base window (Figure 236) and select the Table 
view.
2) Open the spreadsheet in Calc. Use a sheet that is formatted the same as the database 
table. 
3) Place the two windows side by side in the desktop.
318 |Getting Started 24.84) Drag the sheet tab at the bottom of the Calc window into the table list of the database 
file. The mouse pointer shows a square with a + sign. (Sheet tab: This has the name of 
the sheet on it.)
5) Drop the sheet by releasing the mouse button. The Copy table wizard appears to help 
you migrate the content to the database table.
6) When the first page of the wizard appears to select the options of the copy operation and  
name the database table. Each option is explained in the Help (F1). Next, use the 
second page select the sheet columns you want to copy into the table. And finally, the 
third page of the wizard allows you to define the data type of each column of your table.
7) Click Create to populate the new table with the spreadsheet data.
Note
The Copy table operation copies only values and strings from the Calc spreadsheet. 
It does not copy formulas.
Creating queries
If you need get specific information from a database, use a query. Their results are special tables  
within the database. This document will demonstrate two different methods for building queries 
by:
• Use the Query Wizard to generate a list of albums from a particular artist from the CD-
Collection table. 
• The information we might want from the Fuel table includes what our fuel economy is. 
We will do this using Design View. (Queries that require calculations are best created 
with Design View.)
Method 1: Use the Wizard to create a query
Queries created by the Query Wizard provide a list of information—a single answer or multiple 
answers, depending upon the circumstances.
To generate a query with the Wizard, do the following:
1) Open the main database window (Figure 236).
2) Click the Queries icon in the Database section.
3) Select View > Queries, or press Alt+Q. 
In the Tasks section, click Use Wizard to Create Query . The Query Wizard dialog opens 
(Figure 293). We will use the query to find albums by a certain musical group or individual (the 
album’s artist), including when each album was bought.
Note
When working with a query, more than one table can be used. Since different tables 
may contain the same field names, the format for naming fields in a query is table 
name.field name, with a period (.) between the table name and the field name. For 
example, the Lunch field of the Vacations table used in a query has the name 
Vacations.Lunch.
Step 1: Select the fields
1) Select the Table: CD-Collection  option in the Tables drop-down list.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 3192) Find the Available fields list fields in the CD-Collection table:
a) Click Artist, and use the > button to move it to the Fields in the Query  list.
b) Move the AlbumTitle and DatePurchased fields in the same manner. You can also 
move a single field from one list to the other by double-clicking.
c) If you make a mistake, you can return an unwanted field from the Fields in the Query  
list to the Available fields list by selecting it and then typing the < button.
d) In other circumstances, you can use the >> and << buttons to move all fields in one list  
to the other list.
3) Click Next.
Tip
To change the order of the fields, select the field you want to move and click the up 
or down arrow to the right of the Fields in the Query  list.
Step 2: Select the sorting order
Base allows you to sort the information of our query with up to four fields. In this step, we  
must first decide which field is most important. In this query, the artist field is most 
important to us, next field is the album title, and finally the date purchased field is of least  
importance. 
Figure 278: Sorting order page
1) Click the first Sort by drop-down list.
a) Select the CD-Collection.Artist  option.
b) To list the artists in alphabetical order (a-z), select Ascending on the right.
2) Click the first Then by drop-down list.
– Select CD-Collection.AlbumTitle  and then select Ascending.
3) Click the second Then by drop-down list.
– Select CD-Collection.DatePurchased  and then select Ascending.
4) Click Next.
Step 3: Select the search conditions
Next, we will compare the name we entered with the names of the artist in our database 
and decide whether to include a particular artist in our query results or not.
The following options are available:
• is equal to: the same as
• is not equal to: not the same as
• is smaller than: comes before
320 |Getting Started 24.8• is greater than: comes after 
• is equal or less than : the same as or comes before
• is equal or greater than : the same as or comes after
• like: similar to in some way
• not like: is not similar to
• is null:
• is not null:
Note
These conditions apply to numbers, letters (using alphabetical order), and dates.
1) Since we are only searching for one thing, we will use the default setting of Match all of 
the following.
2) We are looking for a particular artist, so select CD-Collection.Artist  in the Fields drop-
down and is equal to in the Condition drop-down.
3) Type the name of the artist in the Value box.
4) Click Next.
Step 4: Select the type of query
We want simple information, so the default setting: Detailed query is what we want. 
Click Next.
Note
Since we have a simple query, the Grouping and Grouping conditions  are not 
needed. Steps 5 and 6 of the wizard are skipped in our query.
Step 7: Assign aliases if desired
The fields, AlbumTitle and DatePurchased, have names made up of two words without 
separation. Instead, aliases can be made containing two words each ( Album Title and 
Date Purchased, respectively).
1) Change the alias for AlbumTitle to Album Title.
2) Change the alias for DatePurchased to Date Purchased.
3) Click Next.
Step 8: Checking results
1) Make sure that you have the query conditions listed in the Overview.
2) If something is wrong, use the Back button to move to the step that contains the error.
3) Then use the Next button to return to this step.
4) Name the query (suggestion: Query_Artists). 
5) To the right of this are two choices. Select Display Query. 
6) Click Finish.
Base displays the LibreOffice Base: Table Data View query showing any records that match the 
query. Close the window when you have finished with it.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 321Method 2: Use Design View to create a query
Creating a query using Design View is not as difficult as it may first seem. It may take multiple 
steps, but each step is fairly simple.
What fuel economy is our vehicle getting (miles per gallon in the USA)? This question requires 
us to create two queries, with the first query used as part of the second query.
Step 1: Open the first query in Design View
• Click Create Query in Design View  in the Tasks area of the main window. Base 
displays the Add Table or query dialog (Figure 279) and the LibreOffice Base: Query 
Design window.
Step 2: Add tables to window
1) In the Add Table or query dialog, click Fuel to highlight it.
2) Click Add.
3) Click Close.
4) Base closes the Add Table or Query dialog and includes the Fuel table in the upper area 
of the Query Design window.
Figure 279: Add Table or Query dialog
Tip
Move the mouse pointer over the bottom edge of the Fuel table (Figure 280) and 
drag the edge to make it longer and easier to see all of the fields in the table.
322 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 280: Fuel table in query
Step 3: Add fields to the table at the bottom
1) Double-click the FuelID field in the Fuel table.
2) Double-click the Odometer field.
3) Double-click the FuelQuantity field.
4) Double-click the FuelCost field.
The query table at the bottom of the Query Design dialog should now have four columns 
(Figure 294).
Step 4: Set the criterion for the query
We want the query to include FuelID values that are greater than 0.
1) Type >0 in the Criterion cell under FuelID in the query table.
2) Click the Run Query icon on the Query Design toolbar(circled in red in Figure 281), or 
click View > Run Query , or press F5.
Figure 281: Run Query icon in Query Design toolbar
Base presents the results of the query in the area above the query table.
Figure 282 shows the Fuel table with sample entries. The query results based upon the Fuel 
table are shown in Figure 283.
Figure 282: Fuel table
Figure 283: Query of Fuel table
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 323Step 5: Save and close the query
Since this query contains the final odometer reading for our calculations, you sure name 
it End-Reading when saving it. Then close the query. Now click the Save icon in the 
main database window.
Step 6: Create the query to calculate the fuel economy
1) Click Create Query in Design View  in the Tasks area to open a new query.
2) Base opens the LibreOffice Base: Query Design window and the Add Table or Query 
dialog.
3) Add the Fuel table to the query just as you did in Step 2: Add tables to window  but do 
not close the Add Table or Query dialog.
4) Add the End-Reading query to this query.
a) Click Queries to get the list of queries in the database (Figure 284).
b) Click End-Reading.
c) Click Add, and then click Close.
d) Base closes the Add Table or Query dialog and displays the Fuel table and End-
Reading query in the upper area of the Query Design window.
Figure 284: Selecting queries to add to another query
Step 7: Add fields to the table at the bottom of the query
When calculating the fuel economy, we will need the fuel quantity and distance traveled. 
Since the final odometer reading reveals the fuel quantity, we will use the End-Reading 
query to get it. We will also use the Odometer field from both the Fuel table and End-
Reading query.
Figure 285: Tables in this query
1) Double-click FuelQuantity in the End-Reading query.
2) Double-click Odometer in the End-Reading query.
3) Double-click Odometer in the Fuel table.
324 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 286: Added fields to the query
Step 8: Enter the FuelID difference field
The difference between the FuelID value of the Fuel table and FuelID value of the End-
Reading query should equal one (1).
1) Type "End-Reading"."FuelID" - "Fuel"."FuelID"  in the field to the right of the 
Odometer field of the Fuel table (Figure 295).
2) Type = '1' in the Criterion cell of this column.
3) Leave the Visible cell of this column unchecked.
4) Calculate the distance traveled:
– Type in the next empty Field cell (Figure 296): "End-Reading"."Odometer" - 
"Fuel"."Odometer"
– In the Alias row, type Distance.
– Type > '0' in the Criterion cell.
5) Calculate fuel economy: Type ("End-Reading"."Odometer" - 
"Fuel"."Odometer")/"End-Reading"."FuelQuantity" in the next column to the 
right of the word Field (Figure 259).
6) Type Fuel Economy as the alias.
Note
When entering fields for these calculations, follow this format: table or query name. 
Then add a period and the field name. For hyphenated or multiple-word names 
(table or query), use double quotes around the table or query name. The query will 
then add the rest of the double quotes as in Figure 259.
Use the arithmetical symbol between the two. More than one calculation can be 
done by using parentheses to group the arithmetical operations. 
Step 9: Run the query and make some modification
First, we will run the query to make sure it works correctly. Once we are sure that the 
query will work, we will hide all of the fields that we do not need.
Figure 287: Result of running the fuel economy query
1) Click the Run Query icon on the Query Design toolbar (Figure 281). The results are 
shown in Figure 287.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 325Two of the column headers are identical. By giving these two headers different aliases, 
we can distinguish them.
2) Add Aliases: Type the aliases as they are listed in Figure 288.
Figure 288: Query table with Odometer aliases added
3) Run the query again. The results are in Figure 289.
Figure 289: Query run with aliases
Step 10: Close, save, and name the query
Name the query Fuel Economy.
1) Click the Save icon.
2) Name the query.
3) Close the query.
4) Save the database file.
There are obviously other calculations that can be made in this query such as cost per distance 
traveled and how much of the cost belongs to each of the payment types.
Note
To fully use queries requires a knowledge of set operations ( unions, intersections, 
and, or, complements, or any combinations of these). Having a copy of the RDBMS 
manuals, is also extremely useful.
Creating reports
Reports retrieve information found in the database and arrange it in useful ways. They are 
similar to queries except that they are designed to be read by people. Queries are only designed  
to retrieve selected data from the database. Reports are generated from the database’s tables, 
views, or queries.
All reports are based upon a single table, view, or query, so first you need to decide what fields 
you want to use in the report. Before you use fields from different tables, you must first combine 
these fields in a single query or view. Then you can use this information to create a report.
For example, a report on vacation expenses includes both fuel costs and meal costs. These 
values are contained in fields of two different tables: Vacations and Fuel. Then this report will 
allow you to create a query or view.
326 |Getting Started 24.8Caution
Dynamic reports update only the data that is changed or added to a table or query. 
They do not show any modifications made to the table or query itself. 
For example, after creating the report below, open the Fuel Economy query created 
in the previous section. For the “End-Reading”.“Odometer” – “Fuel”.“Odometer” 
column, change the number 1 to the number 3 (see Figure 295). The report will be 
identical before and after you make the change. But if you add more data to the 
query and run the report again, it will contain the new data. However, all data will be 
based upon “End-Reading”.“Odometer” – “Fuel”.“Odometer” having the value 1. No 
data will be present in the report for which “End-Reading”.“Odometer” – 
“Fuel”.“Odometer” has the value 3.
Example: Creating a report
We will create a report on vacation expenses. Before we create the report, we will need to know.
• What information do we want in the report?
• How do we want the information arranged?
• What fields are required to provide this information?
• Will a query or view have to be created because these fields are in different tables?
• Are any calculations required in the data before being added to the report?
The expenses for our vacation are motel, tolls, miscellaneous, breakfast, lunch, supper, snacks, 
and fuel. One possible report could list the totals of each of these expense groups. Another 
could list the expense totals for each day of the vacation. A third could list the totals for each 
expense group for each type of payment. (This would let us know where the money came from 
to pay the expenses.) Once you create a query to do any one of these, you can create a report 
based upon the query.
We will now create two reports. One will list the expenses each day (other than fuel) and the 
second listing fuel statistics. The fields we need for the first report from the Vacations table are: 
Date, Motel, Tolls, Breakfast, Lunch, Supper, Snack Cost, and Miscellaneous. This report only 
requires the Vacations table. Had the report listed the total expenses for each of these fields, we 
would have to create a query to provide us with these totals, which is beyond the scope of this 
chapter.
The next report involves the Fuel table. Since this table includes fuel purchases at times other 
than during the vacation, we need to create a query that contains only the fuel purchased during 
vacation periods.
Report Wizard vs Report Design View
1) When you open the Report Wizard, the Report Builder open as well. As you make your 
selections in the wizard, these appear in layout in the Report Builder. When you have 
finished making your selections, you save the report, name it and then close it.
2) When using Design View to create a report, you open the Report Builder to design the 
layout of it. (There is only one layout available when the wizard is used.)
Vacations table report
Before we begin, we must create a new report:
1) Click the Reports icon in the Database area of the main Base window (Figure 236), or 
select View > Reports, or press Alt+R.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 3272) In the Tasks list, click Use Wizard to Create Report . The Report Wizard dialog and the 
Report Builder window open.
Step 1: Field selection
1) Select Table: Vacations in the Tables or queries drop-down list.
2) Use the > to move these fields from the Available fields list to the Fields in report list: 
Date, Motel, Tolls, Miscellaneous, Breakfast, Lunch, Supper, and SnCost. The other 
buttons (<, >>, <<, up arrow, and down arrow) and the double-click action perform similar  
functions to the other wizard pages as described earlier in this chapter.
3) Click Next.
Step 2: Labeling fields
Change any field labels you wish. We will shorten Miscellaneous to Misc. and expand 
SnackCost into two words.
1) Shorten Miscellaneous to Misc.
2) Change SnCost into Snack Cost.
3) Click Next.
Step 3: Grouping
1) Since we are grouping by the date, use the > button to move the Date field from the 
Fields list to the Groupings list.
2) You can use the < button to return an entry in the Groupings list to the Fields list. You can 
use the up and down arrows to re-order entries in the Groupings list or you can double-
click to move a field from one list to the other.
3) Click Next.
Step 4: Sort options
We do not want to do any additional sorting.
• Click Next.
Step 5: Choose layout
1) Select Columnar, three columns  in the Layout of data list.
2) Layout of headers and footers  have no possible selections.
3) Select Landscape as the Orientation for the page layout.
4) Click Next.
Figure 261 shows part of the final template that has been built up in the Report Builder as you 
reach the end of the wizard.
Step 6: Create report
1) Title the report: Vacation Expenses .
2) Select the Dynamic report option.
3) Select the Create report now  option.
4) Click Finish.
5) LibreOffice opens the output report in read-only mode in Writer.
The report (Figure 262) has been created. However, the date could be formatted better and all 
the numbers need to be formatted as currency, and the report could have a heading that 
includes its name, its author, and the date it was prepared. If the report had more than one page,  
328 |Getting Started 24.8the page numbers could be put in a footer of each page, perhaps including the total number of 
pages. But to do these things, you must use Report Builder.
Report Builder: another way to create reports
The Report Builder allows you to create complex database reports. You can define group and 
page headers, group and page footers, and calculation fields. Report Builder is installed with 
LibreOffice.
While the Report Wizard allows us to create a template in Report Builder for our report. When 
we open Report Builder, we open it with this template. By modifying the template, we also modify  
the report. For example, we can change the Date field’s format, and it will change the format of 
all the dates contained in that field in the above report. Similarly, we can change the field 
formatting of any of the other fields and change the format everywhere that field appears in the 
report.
Report Builder can also create reports by itself. To do this, click Create Report in Design View . 
For instructions on how to use the Report Builder, see Chapter 6, Reports, in the Base Guide.
Accessing other data sources
LibreOffice allows data sources to be accessed and then linked into LibreOffice documents. For 
example, a mail merge can link to an external document containing a list of names and 
addresses into a letter. One copy of the letter being generated for each entry.
To access a data source that is not a *.odb file:
1) Select File > New > Database , or click the arrow at the right of the New icon on the 
Standard toolbar and select the Database option in the menu, to open the Database 
Wizard.
2) Select Connect to an existing database . Select the required database type in the drop-
down list. Click Next.
3) The remaining steps in the Database Wizard may vary depending on which database 
type you have chosen.
4) At some stage the wizard may prompt you to browse and select a database of interest. 
Normally, you will select it to register the database and open the database for editing.
5) Finally, click Finish to exit the wizard. Name and save the database in the location of 
your choice.
Accessing a spreadsheet as a data source
Accessing a spreadsheet is similar to accessing other databases:
1) Select File > New > Database , or click the arrow at the right of the New icon on the 
Standard toolbar and select the Database option in the menu, to open the Database 
Wizard dialog.
2) Select Connect to an existing database . Select Spreadsheet in the drop-down list. 
Click Next.
3) Click Browse to locate the spreadsheet you want to access. If the spreadsheet is 
password protected, check the Password required  box. Click Next.
4) Make sure that the Yes, register the database for me  and Open the database for 
editing options are selected.
5) Click Finish to exit the wizard. Name and save the database in the location of your 
choice.
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 329Note
If you access a spreadsheet with this method, you cannot change anything in the 
spreadsheet using Base. You can only view the contents of the spreadsheet, run 
queries, and create reports based upon the data already entered into the 
spreadsheet.
All changes in a spreadsheet must be made in the spreadsheet itself with Calc. After 
modifying the spreadsheet and saving it, the changes will be in the database. When 
you create and save an additional sheet in your spreadsheet, the database will have 
a new table the next time you access it.
Registering *.odb databases
Databases created by LibreOffice are in the *.odb (OpenDocument Database) format. Other 
programs can also produce databases in this format. Registering a *.odb database is simple: 
1) Choose Tools > Options > LibreOffice Base > Databases .
2) Under Registered Databases , click New. LibreOffice displays the Create Database Link 
dialog.
3) Browse to where the database is located. Make sure the registered name is correct.
4) Click OK.
Note
Sometimes after updating LibreOffice to a newer version, your list of registered 
database files disappears. When that happens, you can use these steps to re-
register your database files with your latest version of LibreOffice.
Using data sources in LibreOffice
Once the data source is registered, whether a spreadsheet, text document, external database or  
other accepted data source, you can use it in other LibreOffice components including Writer and 
Calc.
Viewing data sources
First, open a document in Writer or Calc and view the data sources available by pressing 
Ctrl+Shift+F4 or select View > Data Sources . This brings up a list of registered databases,  
including Bibliography and any other registered database, such as the Automobile database 
created earlier in this chapter.
To view each database, click the drop-down arrow for the database’s name (Figure 290). This 
expands to show Queries and Tables. Click the drop-down arrow for Tables to view the individual  
tables created. Now click on a table to see all the records held in it.
Figure 290: Databases in Data Sources window
330 |Getting Started 24.8Editing data sources
Some data sources (but not spreadsheets) can be edited in the Data Sources window. A record 
can be edited, added, or deleted.
View a table’s data
If you click on a table, its rows and columns of data appear on the right side of the Data Sources 
window. Editing this data requires only a click in the cell whose data should be changed, change 
the data, and click in the row above or below it to save the new data.
Beneath the records are five small buttons. The first four move the cursor to the beginning, to the  
left, to the right, and to the end respectively. The fifth button, with a small star, inserts a new 
record.
To delete a record, right-click on the gray box to the left of a row to highlight the entire row, and 
select Delete Rows in the context window to remove the selected row.
Figure 291: Deleting a row in the Data Sources window
Launching Base to work on data sources
You can launch LibreOffice Base at any time in the Data Sources window. Just right-click on a 
database or its Tables or Queries components and select Edit Database File  in the context 
menu. Once in Base, you can edit, add, and delete tables, queries, forms, and reports.
Using data sources in Writer and Calc
Data can be placed into Writer and Calc documents from the tables in the Data Sources window.  
In Writer, values from individual fields can be inserted. Or a complete table can be created in the 
Writer document. One common way to use a data source is to perform a mail merge.
Figure 292: Toolbar for the Data Sources window
Tip
Choose Tools > Mail Merge Wizard  or click on the Mail Merge icon (circled in 
Figure 292) in the Data Sources window to start the Mail Merge Wizard, which steps 
you through creating a mail merge document. See Chapter 14 in the Writer Guide.
Writer documents
When you need to insert a field from a table in the Data Sources window into a Writer document,  
click on the field name (the gray square at the top of the field list) with the left mouse button held 
down, drag the field onto the document. In a Writer document, it will appear as <FIELD> (where 
FIELD is the name of the field you dragged).
Chapter 8,  Getting Started with Base  | 331For example, if you wish to enter the cost of meals and who paid for them on a certain date of a 
vacation into the database:
1) Open the list of data sources ( Ctrl+Shift+F4) and select the Vacations table in the 
Automobile database.
2) Use this sentence: “On (date), our breakfast cost (amount) paid by (name), our lunch 
cost (amount) paid by (name), and our supper cost (amount) paid by (name).” But only 
type 
“On, our breakfast cost paid by, our lunch cost paid by, and our supper cost paid by.”
3) To replace (date), click the field name Date in the Data Sources window and drag it to the  
right of the word On. Insert an extra space if necessary. The result: On <Date>. If you 
have field shadings turned on ( View > Field Shadings ), <Date> has a gray background. 
Otherwise it does not.
4) To replace first (amount), click the Breakfast field name and drag it to the right of our 
breakfast cost. Make sure you have the proper spacing between the field names and the 
words before and after them. Result: breakfast cost <Breakfast> .
5) To replace the first (name), click the BPayment field name and drag it to the right of paid 
by. Result: paid by <BPayment> .
6) In the same way, fill in the rest of the fields in the sentence.
– Use <Lunch> and <LPayment> for the second set of (amount) and (name) in the 
sentence.
– Use <Supper> and <SPayment> for the third set of (amount) and (name) in the 
sentence.
7) Final result: On <Date>, our breakfast cost <Breakfast> paid by <BPayment>, our lunch 
cost <Lunch> paid by <LPayment>, and our supper cost <Supper> paid by <SPayment> .
8) Add data to the fields of the sentence:
a) Click the gray box to the left of the row of data you want to add. That row should be 
highlighted like the second row of Figure 298.
b) Click the Data to Fields icon in the Table Data toolbar (circled in Figure 298). This 
should fill the fields with the data from the row you chose.
c) Click another row and then click this icon again. The data in the sentence changes to 
reflect this selected row of data.
d) Save the document if you want to use it as an example later.
Adding any data in table format is easier. Some of the steps are quite similar.
1) Navigate to the place you want to place the table and click the location.
2) Ctrl+Click the gray box to the left of each row of the data source that you want to be a 
row in your table if the rows are not consecutive. To select consecutive rows, click the 
gray box to the left of the top desired row and Shift+click the bottom desired row.
3) Click the Data to Text icon to open the Insert Database Columns dialog (Figure 264). 
(The Data to Text icon is to the left of the Data to Fields icon in Figure 298.)
4) Move the fields you want in your table from the Database columns  list to the Table 
column(s) list.
– To place the fields in order, click the field and use the single right arrow to move the 
fields in the order you desire. You can also limit the fields you use to less than all of the  
fields available.
332 |Getting Started 24.8– To use all of the fields, use the double arrow pointing to the right to move all of them at  
one time (this icon may have a different appearance in some environments). The order  
of the fields in the table you create will be the same as in the data source table.
– To remove a single field from the Table column(s) list, click the field and use the single 
arrow pointing to the left.
– You can double-click a field in one list to move it to the other list.
5) To start over, click the double arrow pointing to the left (this icon may have a different 
appearance in some environments).
6) Select the settings for your table. Use the default settings as in Figure 264.
7) Click OK. Save the document.
Calc spreadsheets
There are two ways to transfer data into a Calc spreadsheet:
Enter the data into the spreadsheet cells.
Create complete new records in the spreadsheet. While you can directly access the data 
inserted into the spreadsheet cells, new records created in the spreadsheet are read-only.
Use the Data to Text icon to enter data directly to the spreadsheet cells as if you are making a 
table in a Writer document. But there are certain differences.
The steps are straightforward.
Click the cell of the spreadsheet which you want to be the top left cell of your data, including the 
column names. 
1) Use Ctrl+Shift+F4 to open the Data Sources window and select the table whose data you  
want to use. 
2) Select the rows of data you want to add to the spreadsheet:
– Click the gray box to the left of the row (the row header) you want to select if only 
selecting one row. That row is highlighted.
– To select multiple rows, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking the gray box of the rows  
you need. Those rows are highlighted.
– To select all the rows, click the gray box in the upper left corner. All rows are 
highlighted.
3) Click the Data to Text icon to insert the data into the spreadsheet cells.
4) Save the spreadsheet.
Adding records to a spreadsheet is fairly easy. You need to have the Data Sources window 
open, your spreadsheet open, and the table you want to use selected.
1) Drag and drop the gray box containing the field name for the table’s ID field (the column 
header) to where you want the record to appear in the spreadsheet.
2) Repeat until you have copied all of the fields you need to where you want them in the 
spreadsheet.
3) Select File > Save, or click the Save icon on the Standard toolbar, to name and save the  
spreadsheet. Close the file.
Next time you open the spreadsheet, the fields will be populated with data from the first record of  
the table, and the Form Navigation toolbar will appear at the bottom of the spreadsheet.

LibreOffice’s Formula (Equation) EditorIntroduction
Math is a formula editor included with LibreOffice used to create or edit formulas (equations) in a  
symbolic form, within LibreOffice documents or as stand-alone objects. Sample formulas are 
shown below:
df(x)
dx=ln(x)+tan−1(x2)orNH3+H2O⇌NH4++OH−
The Formula Editor in Math uses a markup language to represent formulas. This markup 
language is designed to be easily read by users. For example, a divided by using markup 
language produces the fractiona
bwhen used in a formula.
Figure 300: LibreOffice Math window parts
Getting started
The Formula Editor creates a formula as a separate file that can become a formula library or can  
be inserted directly into a document using LibreOffice Writer, Calc, Impress, or Draw.
Formulas as separate documents or files
To create a formula as a separate document or file, use one of the following methods to open an 
empty formula document in LibreOffice Math:
• On the Menu bar, go to File > New > Formula .
• On the Standard toolbar, click the triangle to the right of the New icon and select 
Formula.
• In the Start Center, click Math Formula.
• From within LibreOffice Math, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N.
338 |Getting Started 24.8When the markup language in the Formula Editor is entered, the formula will appear in the 
Preview window as the markup language is entered in the Formula editor. If the Elements panel 
has been selected in View on the Menu bar, it may appear on the sidebar to the right of the 
Preview window. (Figure 301).
For more information on creating formulas, see “ Creating formulas” below.
Figure 301: Enabling the Elements panel
Formulas in LibreOffice documents
To insert a formula into a LibreOffice document, open the target document in Writer, Calc, Draw, 
or Impress.
• In Writer, click in the paragraph where the formula should be inserted.
• In Calc, click in the spreadsheet cell where the formula should be inserted.
• In Draw and Impress, the formula is inserted into the center of the drawing or slide.
Then, go to the Menu bar and select Insert > Object > Formula Object  to open the Formula 
Editor. Or, you may go to Insert > Object > OLE Object  on the Menu bar to open the Insert OLE  
Object dialog, then select Create new, choose the Object Type “LibreOffice  Formula” and then 
click OK to open the Formula Editor.
The Elements panel will be on the right of the Preview window if Elements has been selected in 
View on the Menu bar.
Figure 302 shows an example Writer document with the formula box selected ready for a 
formula to be entered.
After entering the markup language for the formula, close the Formula Editor by pressing the 
Esc key or by clicking an area outside the formula in the document. If you need to edit the 
formula, double-click on the formula object in the document to open the Formula Editor again. .
Formulas are inserted as OLE objects into documents and can be placed in different ways. For 
more information on OLE objects, see “ Formulas in Writer” , “Formulas in Calc, Draw, and 
Impress” below, and the user guides for Writer, Calc, Draw, and Impress.
Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 339Figure 302: Empty formula in a Writer document
If you need to insert formulas frequently, you should add the Formula button to the Standard 
toolbar or create a keyboard shortcut. See “ Customization” below for more information.
Creating formulas
You can create a formula with one of the following methods:
• Go to the Elements panel, select a category in the drop-down list, then select a symbol.
• Right-click in the Formula Editor and select a category, then select a symbol in the 
context menu.
• Enter markup language directly into the Formula Editor.
Note
Using the Elements panel or the context menus to create a formula provides a 
convenient way to learn the markup language used by Math.
Tip
When using the Elements panel, you ought to select Extended tips in LibreOffice 
Options. This will help you to identify the categories and symbols that need to be 
used in the formula. Go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > General  on the Menu 
bar and select Extended tips in the Help section.
340 |Getting Started 24.8Elements panel
The Elements panel (Figure 301) is a visual tool to help create and edit formulas. It organizes 
mathematical symbols and operators using categories in a drop-down list. The steps below 
describe how to enable the Elements panel and navigate its categories and symbols.
1) Go to View > Elements on the Menu bar to open the Elements panel.
2) Select the category for the formula from the drop-down list at the top of the Elements 
panel.
3) Select the symbol for the formula in the Elements panel. The symbols that are available 
change according to the selected category.
4) After choosing one of the symbols in the Elements panel, the Formula Editor will be 
updated with the Markup notation of the selected symbol.
Note
The Elements panel can either be a floating dialog, as shown in Figure 301, or 
positioned to the right of the Formula Editor, as shown in Figure 302.
Tip
The Elements panel includes an Examples category, which provides example 
formulas to use as a starting point for a formula or equation.
Context menu
The Formula Editor also provides a context menu which allows users to access categories and 
symbols while they are creating formulas. To open the context menu, right-click in the Formula 
Editor. Then select a category and select the markup example for use in the sub-context menu. 
An example is shown in Figure 303.
Figure 303: Context menu in Formula Editor
Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 341Note
The Elements panel and the context menu only contain the commands that are most  
commonly used in formulas. If a symbol or a command is not listed in the Elements 
panel and context menu, you must insert it manually with the markup language. For 
a complete list of commands and symbols available in Math, see Appendix A, 
Commands Reference, in the Math Guide.
Markup language
Markup language is entered directly into the Formula Editor. For example, typing 5 times 4 into 
the Formula Editor creates the simple formula 5×4. For experienced markup language users, it  
can be the quickest way to enter a formula. Table 14 shows some examples of using markup 
language to enter commands. For a full list of commands that can be used in the Formula Editor,  
see Appendix A, Commands Reference, in the Math Guide.
Table 14: Example commands using markup language
Display Command Display Command
a=ba = b √a sqrt {a}
a2 a^2 an a_n
∫f(x)dxint f(x) dx ∑ansum a_n
a≤ba <= b ∞ infinity
a×ba times b x⋅y x cdot y
Greek characters
Using markup language
Greek characters are commonly used in formulas, but they cannot be entered into a formula with  
the Elements panel or the context menu. When entering Greek characters into a formula, use 
the English names of Greek characters in the markup language See Appendix A, Commands 
Reference, in the Math Guide for a list of Greek characters that can be entered using markup 
language.
• For a lowercase Greek character, type a percentage % sign, then type the character 
name in lowercase using the English name. For example, typing %lambda creates the 
Greek character λ.
• For an UPPERCASE Greek character, type a percentage % sign, then type the character  
name in UPPERCASE using the English name. For example, typing %LAMBDA creates 
the Greek character Λ.
• For an italic Greek character, type a percentage % sign followed by the i character, then 
the English name of the Greek character in lower or UPPER case. For example, typing 
%iTHETA creates the italic Greek character Θ.
Symbols dialog
Greek characters can also be entered into a formula using the Symbols dialog.
1) Make sure the cursor is in the correct position in the Formula Editor.
2) Go to Tools > Symbols on the Menu bar, or click the Symbols icon in the Tools toolbar, 
to open the Symbols dialog (Figure 304).
3) Select Greek in the Symbol set drop-down list. For italic characters, select iGreek in the 
drop-down list.
342 |Getting Started 24.84) Double-click the desired Greek character to insert it or select it and click Insert. When 
selected, the name of the character is shown below the symbol list.
5) Click Close after entering Greek characters into the formula.
Figure 304: Symbols dialog
Special characters
In addition to math symbols, special characters can also be part of a formula expression. The 
special characters are handled as text in the formula.
1) Make sure the cursor is in the correct position in the Formula Editor.
2) Go to Tools > Special Characters  on the menu bar
3) Select the Font and Character block in the upper drop-down list box,
4) Select the character in the grid
5) Double-click on the character or select and press Insert.
Formula examples
Example 1
The simple formula 5×4 can be created using LibreOffice Math by performing the following 
steps:
1) Make sure the cursor is flashing in the Formula Editor, then select the category 
Unary/Binary Operators  and symbol Multiplication using one of the following methods:
2) Go to the Elements panel, select Unary/Binary Operators  in the drop-down list, and 
then select the Multiplication icon 
.
– Right-click in the Formula Editor and select Unary/Binary Operators > a times b  in 
the context menu.
– Using markup language, enter 5 times 4 in the Formula Editor.
The first two methods place the formula text <?> times <?> in the Formula Editor and 
the symbol 
 appears in the document. For the third method, using markup 
Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 343language in the Formula Editor places the formula 5×4directly into the document and 
there is no need to carry out steps two or three.
3) Select the first placeholder <?> before the word times in the Formula Editor and replace  
it with the character 5. The formula in the document updates automatically.
4) Select the second placeholder <?> after the word times in the Formula Editor and 
replace it with the character 4. The formula in the document updates automatically.
Tip
To move forward from one placeholder to the next placeholder in a formula, press 
the F4 key. To move backward from one placeholder to the previous placeholder in a 
formula, use the key combination Shift+F4.
Note
If necessary, to prevent a formula in a document from updating automatically. Go to 
View on the Menu bar and deselect AutoUpdate display . To then manually update 
a formula, press the F9 key or select View > Update on the Menu bar.
Example 2
To create the formula π≃3.14159where the value of pi is rounded to 5 decimal places, 
without knowing markup associated with the Is Similar Or Equal  symbol≃, follow these 
steps:
1) Make sure the cursor is flashing in the Formula Editor.
2) Enter %pi in the Formula Editor to enter the Greek character for pi (π).
3) Select the category Relations and symbol Is Similar Or Equal  using one of the 
following methods:
– In the Elements panel, select Relations in the drop-down list and then select the Is 
Similar Or Equal icon 
.
– Right-click in the Formula Editor and select Relations > a simeq b  in the context 
menu.
4) Delete the first placeholder <?> before the word simeq in the Formula Editor.
5) Select the second placeholder <?> after the word simeq in the Formula Editor and 
replace it with the characters 3.14159. The formulaπ≃3.14159now appears in the 
document.
Editing formulas
If you need to edit a formula, the approach differs depending on whether the formula is in Math 
or another LibreOffice component.
1) In Math, double-click on a formula element in the formula that appears in the Preview 
window to select the formula element in the Formula Editor, or directly select a formula 
element in the Formula Editor.
2) In Writer, Calc, Impress, or Draw, double-click on the formula, or right-click on the 
formula and select Edit in the context menu, to open the Formula Editor and enter 
editing mode. The cursor is positioned at the start of the formula in the Formula Editor.
344 |Getting Started 24.8Note
If a formula element cannot be selected using the cursor, click on the Formula 
Cursor icon in the Tools toolbar to activate the formula cursor.
3) Select the formula element to be changed with one of the following methods:
– Click on the formula element in the Preview window, position the cursor at the 
beginning of the formula element in the Formula Editor, then select the formula 
element in the Formula Editor.
– Double-click on the formula element in the Preview window to select the formula 
element in the Formula Editor.
– Position the cursor in the Formula Editor at the formula element to be edited, then 
select that formula element.
– Double-click directly on the formula element in the Formula Editor to select it.
4) Make changes to the selected formula element.
5) Go to View > Update on the Menu bar, or press the F9 key, or click on the Update icon 
on the Tools toolbar to update the formula in the Preview window or in the document.
6) In Math, save changes to the formula after editing.
7) In Writer, Calc, Impress, or Draw, click anywhere in the document away from the formula 
to leave editing mode, then save the document to save changes to the formula.
Formula layout
This section discusses how to lay out complex formulas in Math or in a LibreOffice document.
Using braces
Since LibreOffice Math knows nothing about order of operations within a formula, braces (curly 
brackets) are used to define the order of operations. The following examples show how braces 
can be used in a formula.
Example 1
2 over x + 1 gives the result2
x+1
In this example, Math recognizes that the 2 before and the x after the over command 
belongs to the fraction, and has represented them accordingly. If x+1 rather than x is 
going to be the denominator, they must be bracketed together using braces.
Inserting braces into 2 over {x + 1} gives the result2
x+1where x+1 is now the 
denominator.
Example 2
– 1 over 2 gives the result−1
2
Math recognizes the minus sign as a prefix for the 1 and has therefore placed it in the 
numerator of the fraction. To show that the whole fraction is negative, with the minus sign  
in front of the fraction, the fraction must be put in braces to signify to Math that the 
characters belong together.
Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 345Adding braces into the markup language – {1 over 2} gives the result–1
2and the 
whole fraction is now negative.
Example 3
When braces are used in markup language, they define the layout of the formula and are  
not displayed or printed. To use braces within a formula, use the commands lbrace and 
rbrace within the markup language.
x over {–x + 1}  gives the resultx
–x+1
Replace the braces using the commands lbrace and rbrace in the markup language. 
Write x over lbrace –x + 1 rbrace  and the result is x
{–x+1}
Brackets (parentheses) and matrices
To use a matrix in a formula, the matrix command must be used. Below is a simple example of 
a 2 x 2 matrix.
matrix { a # b ## c # d }ab
cd
In matrices, rows are separated by two hashes (##) and entries within each row are separated 
by one hash (#).
Normally, when brackets are within a matrix, the brackets do not scale as the matrix increases in  
size. The example below shows a formula where the parentheses do not scale to the size of the 
resulting matrix.
( matrix { a # b ## c # d } ) (ab
cd)
To overcome this problem, Math gives you scalable brackets that grow in size to match the size 
of the matrix. Use the commands left( and right) to create scalable brackets around a 
matrix. The following example shows how to create a matrix with scalable parentheses.
left( matrix { a # b ## c # d } right)(ab
cd)
Scalable brackets can also be used with any element of a formula, such as fraction, square root,  
and so on.
To create a matrix where some values are empty, use the grave accent (`) so that Math will put a  
small space in that position, as shown in the example below.
left( matrix { 1 # 2 # 3 ## 4 # ` 
# 6 } right) (123
46)
Tip
Use the commands left [ and right] to obtain square brackets. A list of all 
brackets available within Math can be found in Appendix A, Commands Reference, 
of the Math Guide.
346 |Getting Started 24.8Tip
To make all brackets to be scalable, go to Format > Spacing  on the Menu bar to 
open the Spacing dialog. Click on Category, select Brackets in the drop-down list, 
and then select the option Scale all brackets .
Unpaired brackets
When using brackets in a formula, Math expects that for every opening bracket there is a closing  
one. If there is no closing bracket, Math will place an inverted question mark next to where the 
closing bracket should be placed. For example, lbrace a; b will result in ¿ because the right 
bracket rbrace is missing.
This inverted question mark disappears when all the brackets are paired. The previous example 
could be fixed to lbrace a; b rbrace , resulting in {a;b}. However, there are cases where an 
unpaired bracket is necessary (see below).
Non scalable brackets
When a backslash \ is placed before a non scalable bracket, it indicates that the subsequent 
character should not be regarded as a bracket, but rather as a literal character.
For example, the unpaired brackets in the formula [ a; b [ would result in an inverted 
question mark because Math expects that [ will be closed by ]. To fix the error, use the 
backslash and insert \ [ a; b \ [ into the Formula Editor to obtain [a;b[ as the result.
Scalable brackets
To create unpaired scalable brackets or braces in a formula, the markup commands left, 
right, and none can be used.
Example
The following formula uses the stack command to create a two-line formula and adds a 
bracket only to the right side of the stack.
abs x = left lbrace stack {x "for" x >= 0 # -x 
"for" x < 0} right none|x|={xforx≥0
−xforx<0
This effect can be achieved by using the left lbrace command combined with the 
right none command. The first command indicates that the left bracket is a lbrace 
whereas the second command tells Math that the right bracket will be none, meaning 
that no bracket will be added to the right side of the formula.
Recognizing functions
In a basic installation of Math, the software outputs functions in normal characters and variables 
in italic characters. However, if Math fails to recognize a function, the markup command func 
before a function can force Math to recognize any following text as a function and uses normal 
characters.
For a full list of functions within Math, see Appendix A, Commands Reference, in the Math 
Guide.
Some Math functions have to be followed by a number or a variable. If these are missing, Math 
places an inverted question mark where the missing number or variable should be. To remove 
the inverted question mark and correct the formula, enter a number, a variable, or a pair of 
empty brackets as a placeholder.
Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 347Tip
Use the F3 key to navigate to the next formula error or the key combination 
Shift+F3 to move to the previous error.
Formulas over multiple lines
When a formula requires more than one line, do not press the Enter key to create a new line--
the markup language in the Formula Editor goes to a new line, but the resulting formula does not  
have two lines. To add a new line to the formula, you must use the markup command newline. 
The examples below illustrate how the markup command newline can be used to add a new 
line to a formula.
Examples
The first example simply adds an Enter to break the line in the markup language, which 
does not result in adding a new line, while the second example uses the newline 
command and yields a two-line formula.
Markup Language Resulting Formula
x = 3
y = 1x=3y=1
x = 3 newline y = 1x=3
y=1
Math cannot create multiple line formulas when a line ends with an equals sign or continue the 
formula on a new line without completing the term on the right side of the equals sign. If a 
multiple line formula needs to have an equals sign at the end of a line without a term after the 
equals sign, then use either empty quotes “” or empty braces {} or the space characters grave ` 
or tilde ˜.
By default, a multiple line formula is center aligned. For more information on alignment using the 
equals sign, see “Customization” below.
Spacing within formulas
If you need spacing between the elements in a formula, they are not set by using space 
characters in the markup language. To add spaces into a formula, use one of the following 
options:
• The grave ` to add a small space.
• The tilde ~ for a large space.
• Add space characters between quotes “ ”. These spaces will be considered as text.
Any spaces at the end of a line in the markup language are ignored by default. 
For more information, see “ Adjusting formula spacing ” below.
Adding limits to sum/integral commands
The sum and int commands, which are used for summations and integrals respectively, can use  
the parameters, from and to, to set the lower and upper limits. The parameters from and to 
can be used singly or together as shown by the examples seen below.
348 |Getting Started 24.8For more information on the sum and integral commands, see Appendix A, Commands 
Reference, in the Math Guide.
Examples
Here are some examples of how to add upper and lower bounds to summations and 
integrals. Note that brackets can be used to explicitly define which parts of the formula 
correspond to the desired bounds.
Markup Language Resulting Formula

xij
int from 0 to x f(t) dt ∫
0x
f(t)dt
int_0^x f(t) dt ∫0x
f(t)dt
int from Re f ∫ℜf
Writing derivatives
When writing derivatives, use the over command to identify fractions to Math. The over 
command combined with the character d for a total derivative or the partial command for a 
partial derivative to achieve the effect of a derivative. Braces {} are used in each side of the 
elements to surround them and make the derivative, as shown by the following examples.
Examples
Below are a few examples of using Math to write derivatives.
Markup Language Resulting Formula
{df} over {dx}df
dx
{partial f} over {partial y}∂f
∂y
{partial^2 f} over {partial t^2}∂2f
∂t2
Note
To write function names with primes, as is normal in school notation, first add the 
symbols to the catalog. See “ Catalog customization ” below for more information.
Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 349Markup language characters as normal characters
Characters that are used as controls in markup language cannot be entered directly as normal 
characters. These characters are: %, {, }, &, |, _, ^ and ". For example, 2% = 0.02 in markup 
language will not appear in the formula with the same characters. To overcome this limitation in 
markup language, use one of the following methods:
• Use double quotes to mark that character as text, for example 2"%"= 0.02 will appear in 
a formula as2%=0.02. However, this method cannot be used for the double-quote 
character itself, see “ Text in formulas” below.
• Add the character to the Math Catalog, for example the double quote character.
• Use commands, for example lbrace and rbrace provide literal braces {}.
Note
The Special Characters dialog used by other LibreOffice components is not available  
in Math. For regular use of special characters in Math, adding the characters to the 
Math Catalog is recommended; see “ Catalog customization ” below for more 
information.
Text in formulas
To include text in a formula, enclose any text in double-quotes, for example: x " for " x >= 0  
in markup language will create the formula x for x≥0. All characters, except double quotes, 
can be used in text.
However, if you need double quotes in formula text, create the text with double quotes in 
LibreOffice Writer, then copy and paste the text into the Formula Editor, as shown in Figure 305.
Figure 305: Example of double quotes in formula text
The font used for text in a formula will be the default font that has been set in the Fonts dialog. 
For more information on how to change fonts used for in formulas, see “ Changing formula 
appearance” below.
By default, text alignment is left-justified in formulas. For more information on how to change text  
alignment, see “Adjusting formula alignment ” below.
Formatting text in formulas
Formatting commands are not interpreted within text used in formulas. To use formatting 
commands within formula text, using double quotes to break up the text in the Formula Editor.
Example
Enter the following in the Formula Editor:
350 |Getting Started 24.8"In " color blue bold "isosceles" "triangles, the base angles are 
equal"
creates the following text in a formula In isoscelestriangles, the base angles are equal .
This example shows how to use the markup commands color and bold to format the 
word “isosceles”. Note that the commands are applied to the text within double quotes so  
the formatting commands do not apply to the remainder of the text in the example 
because it is in a separate quote block.
The command color needs to be followed by the name of the desired color or to its RGB or 
hexadecimal value. Refer to Appendix A, Command Reference, in the Math Guide for a list of 
predefined color names.
Aligning formulas using equals sign
LibreOffice Math does not have a command for aligning formulas on a particular character. 
However, a matrix can align formulas on a character and this character is normally the equals 
sign (=). In addition, the markup commands alignr, alignl and alignc can set the alignment 
of each value inside the matrix to the right, left or center, respectively.
Example
The example below uses a matrix to align formulas on the equals sign. Notice how the 
alignment commands align the contents of each position in the matrix.
matrix{ alignr x+y # {}={} # alignl 2 ## alignr  
x # {}={} # alignl 2-y }x+y=2
x=2−y
Note
The empty braces each side of the equals sign are necessary because the equals 
sign is a binary operator and requires an expression on each side. Spaces, or ` or ~ 
characters each side of the equals sign can be used, but braces are recommended 
as they are easier to see within the markup language.
The spacing on each side of the equals sign can be reduced by changing the inter-column 
spacing of the matrix. See “ Adjusting formula spacing ” below for more information.
Changing formula appearance
This section describes how to change the font or font size in a selected formula and change the 
default font or font size.
Note
Only formulas inserted after the change in font settings will use the new default 
settings. Previously inserted formulas would have to be updated individually to match  
the same font settings as the new default settings.
Tip
The extension “Formatting of all Math formulas” allows users to change the font 
name and font size for all or only selected formulas in a document. For more 
information, go to this URL: 
https://extensions.libreoffice.org/en/extensions/show/formatting-of-all-math-formulas

this point on will use the new base size font for formulas.
4) Click OK to save changes and close the Font Sizes dialog.
Font size options
The Font Sizes dialog (Figure 307) specifies the font sizes for a formula. When you select a 
base size, all elements of the formula will be scaled in relation to this base.
• Base size – all elements of a formula are proportionally scaled to the base size. To 
change the base size, select or type in the desired point (pt) size. Other units of measure  
or other metrics can also be automatically converted to points. For example, entering 
1in or 1”, Math converts the value to 72 pt.

354 |Getting Started 24.8Note
When a new font is selected for a formula, the old font remains in the list alongside 
the new one and can be selected again.
Note
Variables should be written in italics, so make sure that the Italic option is selected 
for the desired font. For all other elements, use the basic form of a font. The style 
can be easily altered in the formula itself by using the commands italic or bold to 
set these characteristics and nitalic or nbold to unset them.
Adjusting formula spacing
Use the Spacing dialog (Figure 309) to determine the spacing between formula elements. The 
spacing is specified as a percentage in relation to the defined base size for font sizes.
Figure 309: Spacing dialog
Change current formula spacing
To change the spacing used for the current formula in Math or another LibreOffice component do  
the following:
1) Click in the markup language in the Formula Editor.
2) Go to Format > Spacing  on the Menu bar or click on the Spacing button on the sidebar

Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 3554) Click Default and confirm changes to the formula spacing. Any formulas created from 
this point on will use the new spacing for formulas.
5) Click OK to save changes and close the Spacing dialog.
Note
Only formulas inserted after the change in default spacing will use the new default 
settings. Formulas that were inserted before the change will need to be updated to 
match the same spacing as the new default settings.
Change spacing options
To determine the formula element to be updated, employ the Use Category in the Spacing dialog  
(Figure 309). The appearance of the dialog depends on the chosen category. A preview window 
shows which spacing is modified through the respective boxes.
• Category – defines the selection for the spacing change.
• Spacing – defines the spacing between variables and operators, between lines, and 
between root signs and radicals.
• Indexes – defines the spacing for superscript and subscript indexes.
• Fractions – defines the spacing between the fraction bar and the numerator or 
denominator.
• Fraction Bars – defines the excess length and line weight of the fraction bar.
• Limits – defines the spacing between the sum symbol and the limit conditions.
• Brackets – defines the spacing between brackets and the content.
– Excess size (left/right)  – determines the vertical distance between the upper edge of 
the contents and the upper end of the brackets.
– Spacing – determines the horizontal distance between the contents and the upper end  
of the brackets.
– Scale all brackets – scales all types of brackets. By entering (a over b) in the Formula 
Editor, the brackets will surround the whole height of the argument. Normally, this is 
done by entering left (a over b right).
– Excess size – adjusts the percentage excess size. At 0% the brackets are set so that 
they surround the argument at the same height. The higher the entered value is, the 
larger the vertical gap between the contents of the brackets and the external border of 
the brackets. The field can only be used in combination with Scale all brackets.
• Matrices – defines the relative spacing for the elements in a matrix.
– Line spacing – determines the spacing between matrix elements in a row.
– Column spacing – determines the spacing between matrix elements in a column.
• Symbols – defines the spacing of symbols in relation to variables
– Primary height – defines the height of the symbols in relation to the baseline.
– Minimum spacing – determines the minimum distance between a symbol and variable.
• Operators – defines the spacing between operators and variables or numbers.
– Excess size – determines the height from the variable to the operator upper edge.
– Spacing – determines the horizontal distance between operators and variables.
356 |Getting Started 24.8• Borders – adds a border to a formula. This option is particularly useful for integrating the  
formula into a text file in Writer. When making settings, be sure to not use 0 as a size as 
this creates viewing problems for text that surrounds the insertion point.
• Preview Field – displays a preview of the current selection.
• Default – saves any changes as default settings for all new formulas. A confirmation 
dialog will appear before saving these changes.
Adjusting formula alignment
To determine how formula elements located above one another are aligned horizontally relative 
to each other, use the alignment settings.
Note
It is not possible to align formulas on a particular character and formula alignment 
does not apply to text elements. Text elements are always aligned left.
Note
Independent of using formula alignment given below, it is possible to align formulas 
using the commands alignl, alignc and alignr. These commands also work for 
text elements.
Current formula alignment
To change the alignment used for the current formula in Math or another LibreOffice component:
1) Click in the markup language in the Formula Editor.
2) Go to Format > Alignment  on the Menu bar or click on the Alignment button on the 
sidebar to open the Alignment dialog (Figure 310).
3) Select either Left, Centered, or Right for horizontal alignment.
4) Click OK and check the result in the formula.
Figure 310: Alignment dialog
Note
Regardless of the alignment option selected in the Alignment dialog, it is possible to 
align sections of a formula using the commands alignl, alignc and alignr. 
These commands can align formulas in matrices and work for text elements.
Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 357Default formula alignment
To change the default alignment used for all formulas in Math or another LibreOffice component, 
do the following:
1) Before inserting any formulas into a document, go to Format > Alignment  on the Menu 
bar or click on the Alignment button on the sidebar to open the Alignment dialog (Figure  
310).
2) Select either Left, Centered, or Right for horizontal alignment.
3) Click Default and confirm changes to the formula alignment. Any formulas created from 
this point on will use the new alignment for formulas.
4) Click OK and check the result in the formula.
Note
Only formulas inserted after the change in default alignment will use the new default 
settings. Previously inserted formulas would have to be updated individually to match  
the same alignment as the new default settings.
Changing formula color
The color of characters used in a formula can be changed by using the markup language 
command color followed by a color name, RGB value, or HTML hex value.
This command only works on the formula element immediately after the color name, RGB value,  
or hex value. For example, entering the markup language color red 5 times 4  gives the 
result 5×4. Note that only the number 5 was colored red.
If you need to change the whole formula’s color, use the color command and enclose the whole  
formula within brackets. For example, entering the markup language color red {5 times 4}  
gives the result 5×4.
Named colors
For information on the named colors available in Math, see Appendix A, Commands Reference, 
in the Math Guide. These colors are listed in the Attributes section of the Elements panel (Figure  
301 on page 379).
RGB values
To use custom colors defined by RGB (Red, Green and Blue) values ranging from 0 to 255, use 
themarkup command color rgb R G B  , where R, G, and B correspond to the Red, Green, 
and Blue values of the desired color.
Example
In this example, the term “decision variable” uses the color defined by the RGB values 
160, 82, 45.
"Let " x_ij " be a " color rgb 160 82 45 "decision variable " "in the 
problem under consideration"
Math will create the following output:
Let xij be a decision variable in the problem under consideration
358 |Getting Started 24.8Hex values
The color command now supports HTML colors as defined by a hex number. Use the color 
hex 000000 markup command, where 00000 is the corresponding hex number. For example, 
the command color hex FF0000 decision  creates the output decision.
Background color
It is not possible to select a background color for formulas in LibreOffice Math. By default, the 
background color for a formula is will be the same color as the document or frame that the 
formula has been inserted into. In LibreOffice Writer, you can use object properties to change the  
background color for a formula. For more information, see “ Background and borders ” below.
Building a formula library
To reuse formulas, a formula library can be created to contain the formulas created by the 
Formula Editor. Individual formulas can be saved as separate files using the ODF format for 
formulas (file type .odf), or in MathML format (file type .mml).
LibreOffice Math, Writer, Calc, Draw, or Impress can create formulas and allow you to develop a 
formula library.
Using Math
1) Create a file folder to contain the formula library.
2) In LibreOffice, go to File > New > Formula  on the Menu bar, or click on Math Formula 
in the Start Center to open Math and create a formula using the Formula Editor. See 
“Formulas as separate documents or files ” above for more information.
3) Go to File > Save As on the Menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+S to 
open a Save As dialog.
4) Navigate to the formula library folder created in step 1.
5) Name the formula in the File name box.
6) Select in the File type drop-down list either ODF Formula (.odf)  or MathML 2.0 (.mml)  as 
the file type for the formula.
7) Click Save to save the formula and close the Save As dialog.
Using Writer, Calc, Draw, or Impress
1) Create a file folder to contain the formula library.
2) Open a document using Writer, Calc, Draw, or Impress.
3) Go to Insert > Object > Formula Object  on the Menu bar to open the Formula Editor 
and create a formula. See “ Formulas in LibreOffice documents ” above for more 
information.
4) Right-click on the formula object and select Save Copy as in the context menu to open a  
Save As dialog.
5) Navigate to the folder created for the formula library.
6) Name the formula in the File name box.
7) Select in the File type drop-down list either ODF Formula (.odf)  or MathML 2.0 (.mml)  as 
the file type for the formula.
8) Click Save to save the formula and close the Save As dialog.
Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 359Using a formula library
When you need to add a formula from the formula library into a LibreOffice document, it must be 
inserted as an OLE object. It cannot added to a document by dragging and dropping using the 
mouse or by using Insert > File on the Menu bar: 
1) Open the document in Writer, Calc, Draw, or Impress.
2) Go to Insert > Object > OLE Object  on the Menu bar to open the Insert OLE Object 
dialog.
3) Select the option Create from file.
4) Click Search to open a file browser dialog.
5) Navigate to the formula library folder.
6) Select the formula to be inserted and click Open, or double-click on the formula.
7) Click OK to insert the formula as an OLE object in the document and close the dialog.
Formulas in Writer
When a formula is inserted into a LibreOffice Writer document, the software opens the formula in  
a frame and treats the formula as an OLE object. To edit it, double-click on an inserted formula 
and you will open the formula in LibreOffice Math’s Formula Editor.
In LibreOffice Writer, the following options are available to change each individual formula within 
a document. The chapters on styles in the Writer Guide have information on how to change the 
default frame style settings for OLE objects.
Automatic formula numbering in Writer
Only LibreOffice Writer can perform automatic numbering of formulas for cross-reference 
purposes. The easiest way to add numbered formulas in sequence is to use the AutoText entry 
fn (for 'formula numbered '):
1) Start a new line in the document.
2) Type fn and then press the F3 key. A two column table with no borders is inserted into 
the document with the left column containing a sample formula and the right column 
containing a reference number, as shown below.
E=mc2(1)
3) Delete the sample formula and insert the formula as an object in the left column.
4) Alternatively, first insert the formula into the document, then carry out Steps 1 and 2 
above replacing the sample formula with another formula.
Cross-referencing with formulas in Writer
1) Click in the document where the cross-reference should appear.
2) Go to Insert > Cross-reference  on the Menu bar to open the Fields dialog (Figure 311).
3) Click on the Cross-references tab, then select Text in the Type section.
4) In the Selection section, select the formula number to refer to.
5) In the Insert reference to section, select Reference and click Insert.
6) After creating the cross-references, click Close to close the Fields dialog.
360 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 311: Fields dialog – Cross-references tab
Tip
To insert the cross-reference number without parentheses, select Numbering instead 
of Reference in the Insert reference to section.
Note
To use square parentheses instead of round ones, or to have the cross-reference 
number be separated from the formula by tabs instead of using a table, refer to the 
Writer Guide.
Anchoring formulas
A formula is treated as an object within Writer and once inserted, its default anchoring is To 
character. To change the anchoring of a formula object:
1) Right-click on the selected formula object and select Anchor in the context menu.
2) Select a new anchoring option in the context sub-menu. The anchoring positions 
available are To Page, To Paragraph, To Character, or As Character.
Alternatively:
1) Right-click on the selected formula object and select Properties in the context menu, or 
go to Format > Frame and Object > Properties  on the Menu bar, to open the Object 
dialog (Figure 312).
2) On the Type tab, select an anchoring position from the Anchor section in the upper right.
3) Click OK to save changes and close the Object dialog.
Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 361Figure 312: Object dialog – Type tab with Anchor options
Note
When making changes to the options available for frame styles in Writer, anchoring 
options are not available in the Object dialog. For more information on how to modify  
frame styles, please refer to the Writer Guide.
Vertical alignment
When you are adjusting the vertical alignment of formulas in Writer, the default setting for vertical  
alignment for formula objects is the text base line. If necessary, the default can be changed by 
modifying the Formula frame style--see the chapters on styles in the Writer Guide for more 
information.
To change the vertical alignment position of an individual formula object in Writer (assuming that 
the As character anchoring option is selected):
1) Right-click on the selected formula object and select Properties in the context menu, or 
go to Format > Frame and Object > Properties  to open the Object dialog (Figure 312).
2) Make sure the Type tab is selected and select a new alignment position in the drop-down  
list in the Position section. The vertical alignment options available are Top, Bottom, 
Center, or From bottom.
3) If necessary, type in the text box a plus or minus value for vertical alignment. This option 
is only available if From bottom vertical alignment has been selected.
4) Select the type of text alignment in the drop-down list in the Position section. The text 
alignment options available are Base line, Character, and Row.
5) Click OK to save changes and close the Object dialog.
Note
If the Position section in the Object dialog is grayed out and not available, then go to  
Tools > Options > LibreOffice Writer > Formatting Aids  and uncheck the option 
Math baseline alignment . This setting is stored with the document and applies to all  
formulas within it. Any new documents created will also use this setting for Math 
baseline alignment .
Object spacing
When a formula object is inserted into a Writer document, LibreOffice gives the formula space 
along each side of the formula object. The default value used for spacing is set within the frame 
362 |Getting Started 24.8style for formula objects and it can be changed by modifying the Formula frame style. See the 
chapters on styles in the Writer Guide for more information.
To individually adjust the spacing for each formula object within a document:
1) Create a formula in a Writer document.
2) Right-click on the selected formula object and select Properties in the context menu, or 
go to Format > Frame and Object > Properties  to open the Object dialog.
3) Click on the Wrap tab to open the Wrap page in the Object dialog (Figure 313).
4) In the Spacing section, enter the spacing value for Left, Right, Top, and Bottom spacing.
5) Click OK to save the changes and close the Object dialog.
Figure 313: Object dialog – Wrap tab
Text mode
When you place large formulas within a line of text, the formula’s elements are often higher than 
the text height. Therefore, to make large formulas easier to read, you should always insert large 
formulas into a separate paragraph of their own so that the formula is separated from nearby 
text.
However, if it is necessary to place a large formula within a line of text, double-click on the 
formula to open the Formula Editor and then go to Format > Text Mode  on the Menu bar. The 
Formula Editor will try to shrink the formula to fit the text height. The numerators and 
denominators of fractions will be shrunk, and the limits of integrals and sums are placed beside 
the integral/sum sign, as shown in the following example.
Example
A formula in a separate paragraph:
∑
i=25
i2
and the same formula embedded into a line of text using text mode format: ∑i=25i2
Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 363Background and borders
The default setting for background (area fill) and borders for formula objects is set by the 
Formula frame style. To change the default setting for the Formula frame style, refer to the 
chapters on styles in the Writer Guide. However, the background and borders can be changed 
for individual formulas in a document.
Note
When a formula is inserted into a Writer document, the size of its surrounding frame 
cannot be changed. The frame size for a formula object depends on the setting of 
the formula font size. See “ Formula font size” above for more information.
Backgrounds
1) In the document, select the formula for the background change.
2) Right-click on the formula and select Properties in the context menu, or go to Format > 
Frame and Object > Properties  to open the Object dialog.
3) Click on the Area tab and use the buttons at the top to select the desired type of fill for 
the formula (Figure 314).
4) Select the options for the formula background. The options change depending on the 
type of fill selected.
5) Click OK to save changes and close the Object dialog.
Figure 314: Object dialog – Area tab
Borders
1) In the document, select the formula that needs a border change.
2) Right-click on the formula and select Properties in the context menu, or go to Format > 
Frame and Object > Properties  to open the Object dialog.
3) Click on the Borders tab and select the options for the formula borders (Figure 315).
4) Click OK to save changes and close the Object dialog.
364 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 315: Object dialog – Borders tab
Quick insertion of formulas
To insert formula markup language into a Writer document without opening the Formula Editor:
1) Enter the formula markup language into document at the position where it should be 
placed.
2) Select the markup language.
3) Go to Insert > Object on the Menu bar and select Formula Object to create a formula 
from the selected markup language.
4) Alternatively use the key combination Ctrl + Insert to open the Insert OLE Object 
dialog and then select Formula.
Formulas in Calc, Draw, and Impress
When you insert formulas into Calc, Draw, and Impress, they are inserted as OLE objects 
without any background (area fill) or borders. Each formula object is inserted into a spreadsheet,  
drawing, or slide as follows:
• In Calc, formulas are inserted into a selected cell in a spreadsheet with no style assigned  
to the formula object.
• In Draw and Impress, formulas are inserted into a central position on a drawing or slide 
and, by default, are assigned the drawing object style Object with no fill and no line . For 
more information on how to modify or assign drawing object styles, see the Draw Guide 
or the Impress Guide.
Anchoring formulas in Calc, Draw and Impress
Calc
A formula object can be anchored into a spreadsheet as To Page (default setting), or as To Cell. 
To change the anchoring type of formulas in a Calc spreadsheet:
1) Select the formula object in the spreadsheet.
Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 3652) Right-click on the formula and select Anchor > To Page  or To Cell in the context menu.
3) Alternatively, go to Format > Anchor on the Menu bar and select To Page or To Cell.
Tip
If an inserted formula in a Calc spreadsheet appears out of scale, fix it by right-
clicking the formula object and then selecting the Original Size option in the context 
menu.
Draw and Impress
When a formula is inserted into a drawing or slide, it is inserted as a floating OLE object and is 
not anchored to any particular position in the drawing or slide.
Formula object properties
The properties of formula objects in Calc, Draw, and Impress can be modified just like any other 
object that has been placed in a spreadsheet, drawing, or presentation (with the exception of 
formula object size and the format of any text within a formula). For more information on how to 
change object properties, see the Calc Guide, Draw Guide and Impress Guide.
The following points will help determine which dialog that you should use to change the 
properties of a formula object:
• For a formula’s background, use the various options in the tabs of the Area dialog.
• For a formula’s border, use the various options in the Line dialog. Note that formula 
borders are separate from cell borders in a Calc spreadsheet.
• To accurately re-position a formula object, use the various options in tabs of the Position 
and Size dialog.
• In Draw and Impress, formula objects can be arranged, aligned, grouped, flipped, 
converted, combined, and edited.
• The text attributes of a formula object cannot be changed. The text used in a formula is 
set when creating the formula in the Formula Editor.
• Formula object size is set by the formula font size when the formula is created in the 
Formula Editor. The formula object size is protected in the Position and Size dialog, but 
this can be deselected if desired. However, this is not recommended as resizing a 
formula object using the Position and Size dialog could lead to distortion of the formula 
making it difficult to read.
Formulas in charts
A chart in a Calc spreadsheet is itself an OLE object, therefore, the Formula Editor cannot be 
used to create and insert a formula directly into a chart. However, both the Chart and Math 
objects can be created separately and later be copied and pasted into the Chart object:
1) Create the chart using LibreOffice Calc. For a complete reference on how to create 
charts, see Chapter 3 in the Calc Guide.
2) Click at any cell in the spreadsheet so that the Chart is no longer selected.
3) Insert a Math Formula object by clicking Insert > Object > Formula .
4) Type the desired formula into the Formula Editor.
5) After editing the formula, select the Math Formula object and press Ctrl+C to copy the 
Formula object to the clipboard.
366 |Getting Started 24.86) Double-click the chart object to start editing the chart and press Ctrl+V to paste the 
Formula object into the chart.
7) Now the object can be positioned anywhere inside the chart.
To change the formula, repeat the whole process of creating, copying, and pasting the Formula 
object into the chart.
Chemical formulas
The primary purpose of Math is to create mathematical formulas, but it can also be used to write 
chemical formulas. However, in chemical formulas, the chemical symbols are normally written in 
uppercase using non-italic characters.
To create chemical formulas using Math, change the font used for variables to a non-italic font. 
For more information on how to change fonts in a formula, see “ Formula fonts” above.
For reversible reactions in chemical formulas, there is no symbol for a double arrow in Math. 
With access to a font with correct symbols for use in chemical formulas, these symbols can be 
added to the Catalog. See “ Catalog customization ” below for more information.
Customization
This section describes how to customize LibreOffice Math formula creation in LibreOffice 
documents. Additional information on customizing LibreOffice can be found in Chapter 13, 
Customizing LibreOffice.
Adding keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts can be added to LibreOffice to make creating documents much easier. See 
Chapter 13, Customizing LibreOffice, for instructions.
Catalog customization
For regular use of a symbol that is not available in Math, add it to the Symbols dialog (Figure  
316) by using the Edit Symbols dialog (Figure 317).

Bold, Italic.
8) Click Add, then click OK to close the Edit Symbols dialog. The new symbol and, if 
created, new symbol set are now available for use.
Note
After a new symbol is added to the catalog, it can be added to a new formula by 
typing a percentage sign (%) followed by the new name into the markup language. 
Remember that symbol names are case sensitive, for example, %prime is a different 
symbol to %Prime.
368 |Getting Started 24.8Note
By default, only those user-defined symbols in the document are stored with it and 
they are only available in that document. If necessary, you can embed all user-
defined symbols, so that when the document is transferred to another computer it 
can be edited by another person. Go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice Math >

Chapter 9,  Getting Started with Math  | 369Formula spacing
If you need to modify a formula’s spacing, the grave accent (`) inserts an additional small space 
and the tilde (~) inserts an additional large space into formulas. However, in the basic installation  
of LibreOffice, they are ignored when they occur at the end of a formula. If you are employing 
text in a formula, it may be necessary to include spacing at the end of formulas as well. This 
customization is only required when working with a Math document and is not required when 
inserting a formula into another LibreOffice component.
To add spacing at the end of formula in Math, go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice Math > 
Settings on the Menu bar and uncheck Ignore ~ and ` at the end of the line  in the 
Miscellaneous Options  section.
Note
To customize LibreOffice Math settings, open LibreOffice Math and then navigate to 
Tools > Options > LibreOffice Math > Settings .
Scaling of code in the Formula Editor input window
By default, the code in the Formula Editor input window (Figure 306) is scaled to 100%. 
However, the LibreOffice Math section in the Options dialog can only be accessed from within 
the Math component. It is not available when editing a formula in a document in any other 
LibreOffice component. The scaling factor can be changed by going to Tools > Options > 
LibreOffice Math > Settings  on the Menu bar and changing the percent in the Scaling code 
input window box in the Miscellaneous Options  section. For example, if the scaling is changed 
to 150%, the code in the input window will appear larger. This setting affects the Formula Editor 
in all LibreOffice components. 
Extensions
For frequent formula creation and editing, you can customize LibreOffice by adding extensions 
that are designed to help create formulas. Extensions are easily installed using the Extension 
Manager. For more information on how to install extensions, see Chapter 13, Customizing 
LibreOffice.
A commonly used extension is Formatting of All Math Formulas . It allows all Math formulas to 
be formatted in a Writer, Calc, Draw, or Impress document. With it the font names and font sizes 
of all formulas can be changed in a document. For more information on this extension, go to 
https://extensions.libreoffice.org/en/extensions/show/formatting-of-all-math-formulas .
Exporting and Importing
MathML format
In addition to exporting documents as PDFs, LibreOffice offers the possibility of saving formulas 
in the MathML format. This allows the insertion of formulas into documents that were created in 
other software, for example, Microsoft Office or an internet browser.
Note
If internet browsers do not fully support the MathML format, they may not display the 
formulas correctly. 
If working on a Math document, go to File > Save as on the Menu bar or use the keyboard 
combination Ctrl+Shift+S to open the Save as dialog. Select MathML in the list of available 
file formats in File type to save the formula as MathML.
370 |Getting Started 24.8If you are working in another LibreOffice component, right-click on the formula object and select 
Save Copy as in the context menu to open the Save as dialog. Select MathML in the list of 
available file formats in File type to save the formula object as MathML.
MathML formulas can be imported into Math by using Tools > Import MathML from Clipboard  
on the Menu bar.
Microsoft file formats
To control how formulas in Microsoft format are imported and exported using LibreOffice, go to 
Tools > Options > Load/Save > Microsoft Office  on the Menu bar and select or deselect the 
options for MathType to LibreOffice Math or reverse .
• [L]: Load and convert the object
• [S]: Convert and save the object
[L]: Load and convert the object
When a Microsoft document must be opened in LibreOffice, this option allows you to convert 
Microsoft OLE objects into the specified LibreOffice OLE objects. For formulas, any embedded 
MathType objects must not exceed the MathType 3.1 specifications to be successfully loaded 
and converted. Information on MathType format can be found at 
https://docs.wiris.com/en/mathtype/office_tools/microsoft_office .
If a document containing OMML formulas has been saved in .docx format and then converted to 
the older .doc format, then any OMML objects are converted into graphics, which will be 
displayed in LibreOffice as graphics.
[S]: Convert and save the object
If LibreOffice OLE objects need to be converted and saved in Microsoft file format, select this 
option, which will allow LibreOffice to convert any formulas into a format that can be read and 
modified by Microsoft Equation Editor and MathType.
When this option is not selected, the formula is treated as an OLE object on conversion into 
a .doc format and remains linked to LibreOffice. A double-click on the object in Microsoft Office 
will attempt to launch LibreOffice.

When opening a Word document that contains an embedded equation editor object, if the option  
MathType to LibreOffice Math or reverse  is checked in Tools > Options > Load/Save > 
Microsoft Office (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > Load/Save > Microsoft Office ), the 
object is automatically converted to a LibreOffice Math object.
Chapter 10  Working with File Formats, Security, and Exporting  | 375File formats for saving
If you save a LibreOffice file in an ODF format, that file will be correctly rendered if it is 
transferred to another user;reopened in a later version of LibreOffice; or opened with another 
application that can open ODF files. Thus, we strongly recommend that you save files in an ODF  
as file format. However, files can be saved in other formats, if required.
Tip
If the document needs to be shared and it is not going to be modified, the preferred 
option is to convert the document to PDF. LibreOffice has an easy method to convert 
documents to PDF.
Text documents
In addition to the ODF text formats (.odt, .ott, and .fodt), Writer can save files in the following 
formats:
• Office Open XML Text (.docx)
• Microsoft Word 2007–365 (.docx, .dotx)
• Microsoft Word 97–2003 (.doc)
• Microsoft Word 2003 XML (.xml)
• Rich Text Format (.rtf)• Text (.txt)
• Text Encoded (.txt)
• Unified Office Format text (.uot, .uof)
• HTML Document (.html and .htm)
• DocBook (.xml)
Notes
Since LibreOffice provides encryption support within the Microsoft Word filter, 
password protected Microsoft Word documents can be saved.
While the .rtf format is often used to transfer text files between applications, there is 
a loss of formatting and images. Thus, users should employ other formats.
Spreadsheets
Calc can save in the ODF spreadsheet formats (.ods, .ots, and .fods) as well as the following 
formats:
• Office Open XML Spreadsheet (.xlsx)
• Data Interchange Format (.dif)
• Microsoft Excel 2007–365 XML (.xlsx)
• dBase (.dbf)
• Microsoft Excel 97–2003 (.xls and .xlw)
• SYLK (.slk)• Microsoft Excel 97–2003 Template (.xlt)
• Text CSV (.csv and .txt)
• Microsoft Excel 2003 XML (.xml)
• Unified Office Format spreadsheet 
(.uos)
• HTML Document (Calc) (.html and .htm)
376 |Getting Started 24.8Presentations
Impress can save in the ODF presentation formats (.odp, .otp, .fodp, and .odg), as well as the 
following formats. Impress can also export to Draw-compatible graphic formats.
• Microsoft PowerPoint 2007–365 
(.pptx, .potm)
• Microsoft PowerPoint 2007–365

graphics formats:
• APNG – Animated Portable Network 
Graphic 
• BMP – Windows Bitmap
• EMF – Enhanced Metafile
• EMZ – Compressed Enhanced Metafile
• EPS – Encapsulated PostScript
• GIF – Graphic Interchange Format
• JPEG – Joint Photographic Expert 
Group• PNG – Portable Network Graphic
• SVG – Scalable Vector Graphics
• SVGZ – Compressed Scalable Vector 
Graphics
• TIFF – Tagged Image File Format
• WEBP – WebP Image

• WMF - Compressed Windows Metafile
Writer/Web documents
Writer/Web can save to the following formats:
• HTML document (.html and .htm), as HTML 4.0 Transitional
• Text and Text Encoded (LibreOffice Writer/Web) (.txt)
Exporting files
LibreOffice uses the term “export” for file operations where there is a change of file type. Unlike 
Save As, exporting the file produces a document while keeping the current file format of the 
actual document. If the file type cannot be found in File > Save As on the Menu bar, check File 
> Export on the Menu bar (not available in Math) for additional file types.
Chapter 10  Working with File Formats, Security, and Exporting  | 377Figure 318: Export dialog
If the PDF file format is needed, LibreOffice can export Writer, Calc, Impress, and Draw, 
documents in that format. Writer can also export in EPUB. Also, LibreOffice can export files in 
HTML and XHTML formats. Draw and Impress can also export in several image and graphic 
formats.
Note
If you use the Export command, LibreOffice will create a copy of the file as a new file 
using the selected format. The original file will remain open in LibreOffice.
PDF quick export
If a file needs to be quickly exported to the PDF format, LibreOffice is unable to select various 
file options such as file format, page range, and image compression. For a quick PDF export, do 
the following:
1) Open the target file in LibreOffice.
2) Open the Export dialog (Figure  318) and use one of the following methods:
– Click on Export Directly as PDF  on the Standard toolbar.
– Go to File > Export As > Export Directly as PDF  on the Menu bar. 
3) Enter a file name and select the required location for the PDF file in the Export dialog.
4) Click on Export to create the PDF file and close the Export dialog.
Note
By default, a file in PDF format is not protected against contents tampering, or 
editing. Contents of a PDF file can be edited by specialized software tools, including 
LibreOffice Draw.
378 |Getting Started 24.8Controlled PDF export
If you need more control over the content and quality of a file that will be exported in the PDF 
format, do the following in the PDF Options dialog (Figure  319):
Figure 319: PDF Options dialog — General page
1) Open the target file in LibreOffice.
2) Access PDF Options by going to File > Export As > Export as PDF .
3) Select the various options required on each tabbed page of the PDF Options dialog.
4) Click on Export to open the Export dialog.
5) Navigate to the required folder for the PDF file.
6) Enter a file name the PDF file and click on Export to save the PDF file in its selected 
location.
General PDF options
Refer to Figure 319 to see the PDF options available on the General page of the PDF dialog.
Range
Sets the export options for the pages included in a PDF file.
All
Exports all defined print ranges. If no print range is defined, the entire document will be  
exported.
Pages
Exports the pages that you have selected. To export a range of pages, use the format 
3-6. To export single pages, use the format 7;9;11. If you want, you can export a 
combination of page ranges and single pages, by using a format like 3-6;8;10;12.
Selection
Exports all the current selection.
View PDF after export
Opens the exported PDF file in the default PDF viewer application.
Chapter 10  Working with File Formats, Security, and Exporting  | 379Images
Sets the PDF export options for images in a PDF file.
Lossless compression
Selects lossless compression for the image. All pixels are preserved. This setting can 
create large files when used with photographs.
JPEG compression quality
Determine the JPEG compression’s quality level. Almost all pixels are preserved if you 
choose a high quality level, but if you use a low quality level, file sizes are reduced but 
some pixels are lost and artifacts are introduced.
Reduce image resolution
Lower DPI (dots per inch) images have lower quality. Lower resolutions (100 DPI or 
less) may be sufficient for viewing on a computer screen, but many modern devices 
have much higher resolutions. For printing it is generally preferable to use at least 300 
or 600 DPI, depending on the capability of the printer. Higher DPI settings increase the  
size of the exported file.
Note
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) images with embedded previews are exported only 
as previews. EPS images without embedded previews are exported as empty 
placeholders.
Watermark
Add a centered, vertical, light green watermark text to the page background. The 
watermark is not part of the source document.
Sign with watermark
Insert the required text for the watermark signature. When this option is selected, a 
watermark signature appears on the PDF pages.
General
Sets general PDF export options.
Hybrid PDF (embed ODF file)
Use this setting to export the document with a hybrid file format: PDF and ODF. In PDF  
viewers it behaves like a normal PDF file, but remains fully editable in LibreOffice.
Archive (PDF/A, ISO 19005)
Converts to the PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-2b, or PDF/A-3b format. All fonts used in the source  
document are embedded in the generated PDF file, and PDF tags are created. The 
primary purpose is to create an electronic document whose appearance is 
independent of device and application, making it suitable for long term preservation.
PDF/A-2b is recommended for most users, because it allows for layers and 
transparency with shapes and images. It also compresses better (JPEG 2000) than 
PDF/A-1b, usually producing smaller files. PDF/A-3b is identical to PDF/A-2b, but also 
accepts embedding of other file formats.
Universal Accessibility (PDF/UA)
Creates a universal, accessible PDF file that follows the requirements of PDF/UA (ISO 
14289) specifications.
Tagged PDF (add document structure)
Tagged PDFs contain information about the structure of document contents. This can 
help to display the document on devices with different screens and using screen 
380 |Getting Started 24.8reader applications. Some tags that are exported are table of contents, hyperlinks, and  
controls. This option can increase file sizes significantly.
Create PDF form
If you are submitting forms within the PDF file, select the available options from the 
Submit format drop-down list. This menu will override the URL property that is set in 
the document. Only one setting is valid for the PDF document: PDF (sends the whole 
document); FDF (sends the control contents); HTML, and XML. Normally PDF format 
is selected.
Allow duplicate field names
Allows the use of the same field name for multiple fields in a generated PDF file. If 
disabled, field names are assigned generated unique names.
Structure
Sets options for diverse features such as bookmarks, comments, page layout, and so on.
Export outlines
Use this option to export bookmarks of Writer documents as PDF bookmarks. 
Bookmarks are created for all outline paragraphs and for all table of contents entries 
where hyperlinks are assigned in the source document.
Only paragraphs with Outline level 1 — 10 are exported. The name of the Paragraph 
Style is irrelevant. For example, the default version of Paragraph Style Title is not 
exported when its Outline level is Text Body.
Export placeholders
This option is only available in Writer. The user can choose if the PDF file will include 
any defined placeholder fields, which can be filled in by users.
Comments as PDF annotations
If this option is selected, comments are included in the PDF file as annotations.
To export comments of Writer documents as displayed in LibreOffice, select Tools > 
Options > LibreOffice Writer > Print  (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > 
LibreOffice Writer > Print ) and select the In margins option in Comments. The 
exported pages are scaled down and the comments are placed into margins.
Export automatically inserted blank pages
If selected, blank pages are automatically inserted in the PDF file. This is 
recommended if you are printing the PDF file as a double-sided document. For 
example, books usually have chapters set to start on an odd-numbered (right-hand) 
page. When the previous chapter ends on an odd page, LibreOffice inserts a blank 
page between the two odd pages. This option controls whether to export that blank 
page.
Use reference XObjects
This option determines how PDF images will be exported back into a PDF file.
When this option is disabled, the first page of the PDF data is included in the output. 
The PDF export merges images, fonts and other resources during export. This is a 
complex operation, but the result can be viewed in various viewers.
If this option is enabled, the reference XObject markup is used. This is a simple 
operation, but PDF viewers must support this to use vector images. Otherwise, a 
fallback bitmap is shown in the viewer.
More information can be found in the PDF specification, ISO 32000-2:2017  
(https://www.iso.org/standard/63534.html ).

• Digital signatures are used to ensure that the PDF was really created by the original 
author and that the document has not been modified since it was signed.
• The signed PDF export uses the keys and X.509 certificates already stored in a default 
key store location, or on a smart card.
• When using a smart card, it must already be configured for use by a key store. This is 
usually done during installation of smart card software.

Enter the password that will be used to protecting the private key associated with the 
selected certificate. Usually this is the key store password.
Notes
If the key store password has already been entered in the Select Certificate dialog 
box, the key store may already be unlocked and not require the password again. But 
to be on the safe side, enter the password.
When using a smart card, enter the PIN here. Some smart card software prompts 
you to enter the PIN again before signing. 
Location, Contact information, Reason
These three fields allow additional information to be entered about the digital signature  
that is applied to the PDF (where, by whom and why it was made). It is embedded in 
the appropriate PDF fields and is visible to anyone viewing the PDF. Each, or all of the 
three fields, are optional and may be left blank.
Time Stamp Authority
The PDF signing process uses the Time Stamp Authority (TSA) to obtain a digitally 
signed timestamp that is then embedded in the signature. This (RFC 3161) timestamp 
allows viewing of the PDF to verify when the document was signed.
If no TSA URL is selected (the default), the signature is timestamped, but it uses the 
current time from the local computer.
EPUB format export (Writer only)
EPUB is standard for electronic book files with the extension . epub that can be downloaded and 
read on devices like smartphones, tablets, computers or e-readers. The EPUB format is 
implemented as an archive file consisting of HTML files carrying the content, along with images 
and other supporting files.
Writer can export a file to EPUB. A text-only document generally exports well, but some contents  
(such as illustrations, tables, and cross-references) may not export correctly.
Quick EPUB export
If you choose to quickly export a Writer file to the EPUB file format, there is no control over 
content and quality of the EPUB file.
1) Open the Writer file that is going to be converted.
2) Go to File > Export As > Export Directly as EPUB  on the Menu bar and the Export 
dialog opens.
3) Navigate to the folder where the EPUB file is going to be saved.
4) Enter a file name in the File name text box. The format of the exported file is fixed to 
EPUB Document (. epub).
5) Click on Export and the Writer file is converted to an EPUB file and saved in the 
selected location.
388 |Getting Started 24.8Controlled EPUB export
To control the content and quality of the resulting EPUB file in Writer, do the following:
1) Open the Writer file that is going to be converted.
2) Go to File > Export As > Export as EPUB  and open the EPUB Export dialog 
(Figure 325).
3) Enter the necessary information into the various options in EPUB Export dialog. For 
more information, refer to “ EPUB export options ” below.
4) Click OK to close the EPUB Export dialog and open the Export dialog.
5) Navigate to the folder where the EPUB file is going to be saved.
6) Enter a file name in the File name text box. The format of the exported file is fixed to 
EPUB Document (. epub).
7) Click on Export and the Writer file is converted to an EPUB file and saved in the 
selected location.
Figure 325: EPUB Export dialog
Tip
Other ways to export to EPUB from Writer (. odt) files include Calibre, an open 
source e-book manager that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Calibre provides 
many e-book conversion facilities (including PDF to EPUB) and allows editing of the 
conversion. See https://calibre-ebook.com/  for more information.
EPUB export options
General
Version
Sets the version of the resulting EPUB file.
Chapter 10  Working with File Formats, Security, and Exporting  | 389Split method
Select the type of start of the next EPUB section.
Heading — Starts the next section on headings, according to the document outline 
numbering.
Page break — Starts the new section on a page break.
Layout method
Determines the layout that is generated for the EPUB document.
Reflowable — Content flows (or reflows) to fit the screen and to fit the needs of the 
user. This also means that page style information (for example, page size or 
header/footer content) will not be exported.
Fixed — Gives greater control over presentation when a reflowable EPUB is not 
suitable for its content.
Customize
Custom cover image
Enter the full path of the custom cover image file. If the entry is empty, the exporter 
uses the cover image in the media directory when the name is one of the following: 
cover.gif, cover.jpg, cover.png , or cover.svg. The custom cover image is 
embedded in the EPUB file.
Custom media directory
Enter the custom media directory for the EPUB file. The media directory may contain a  
cover image as seen above, custom metadata and image links.
By default, the exporter looks inside a folder in the current document directory with the 
same name of the document file name for custom media and custom metadata. For 
example, if the document name is MyText.odt, the default media folder for cover and 
metadata is MyText in the current directory.
For custom metadata, provide a file with same name as the original filename with the 
extension .xmp. The provided metadata overrides the internal document metadata. In 
the example above, the custom metadata must exist in the MyText directory as 
MyText.xmp.
Image links mean that if create relative links are created on images or text and they 
link an image that is available in the media directory, then this media is available in the 
EPUB export file as a pop-up.
Metadata
Enter the custom metadata that overrides the document default metadata. These text 
fields can be left empty.
Identifier
Enter a unique identifier for the publication.
Title
Enter the title of the publication.
Author
Enter the Author of the publication.
Language
Language of the publication (see RFC4646 and ISO 639 for possible values).
Date
Last modification date for the publication. The value of this property must be an XML 
Schema date Time conformant date in the form: CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ. Default is  
the date and time when the export dialogue box opened.
390 |Getting Started 24.8Creating HTML files
The easiest way to create HTML documents in LibreOffice is to start with an existing text 
document. For example, in Writer, go to View > Web and the view will change to show how the 
text document appears as a web page. However, Web view does not show which features will, 
or will not be saved correctly in HTML format. Refer to “ HTML files using Writer/Web ” below for 
more information on creating a web page from a text document.
Text documents
Note
The use of styles in the text document is strongly recommended when saving, or 
exporting to HTML, or XHTML format.
Saving a text document as HTML is limited by the HTML 4.0 Transitional 
specification. Text documents in office suites normally use a richer set of resources 
that do not appear in HTML, for example page formatting. Do not expect the same 
layout when saving a file in HTML format.
Saving as HTML
A text document can be saved in HTML format so that it can be viewed in a web browser. To 
generate a separate HTML page, you can associate a page break with a specific heading 
paragraph style each time that style appears in the document. The Writer module automatically 
creates a page containing hyperlinks to each of these pages.
When you save a text document in HTML format, any graphics in the document are saved into 
the HTML document as embedded data streams. For graphics, JPEG, or SVG formats are 
saved as HTML and all other graphic formats are saved as PNG.
LibreOffice generates the image files and the HTML file necessary to create an HTML page in a 
browser. The number of files generated by the format conversion depends on the number of 
images and objects in the original text document. Refer to Table  15 for the file types created and 
file content when saving HTML format.
Table 15: File types created saving in HTML format
File Contents
Myfile.htmlThe text contents, page layout, text attributes, meta 
tags, and styles.
Myfile_html_[random number].gif GIF images of visible contents of OLE objects.
Myfile_html_[random number].png, 
jpg, or bmpImages inserted in the text document as PNG, BMP, or 
JPEG keep their original format.
To create a HTML file from a text document, do the following:
1) Create a new folder which will be a location for the HTML file and images.
2) To open the Save As dialog, select File > Save As on the Menu bar.
3) Navigate to the required location in the Save As dialog.
4) Enter a file name for the HTML file in the File name: text box.
5) In File type:, select HTML Document (Writer) (.html)  as the file type.
6) Click on Save to save the file as HTML and close the Save As dialog.
7) If necessary, click on Use HTML Document (Writer) Format  in the Confirmation dialog 
that opens confirming the file is saved as HTML.
Chapter 10  Working with File Formats, Security, and Exporting  | 391Export as XHTML
If you want LibreOffice to export a text document as a XHTML file, LibreOffice generates an 
XHTML file for each text document. Image files are also embedded in the XHTML file. 
LibreOffice-generated XHTML files have better layout rendering, but fail to render objects other 
than images.
1) If necessary, create a new folder as a location for the HTML file and images.
2) Go to File > Export on the Menu bar to open the Export dialog (Figure  318 on 
page 422).
3) Navigate to the location of the new folder in the Export dialog.
4) Enter a file name for the HTML file in the File name: text box.
5) In File type:, select XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language)  as the file type.
6) Click on Export to save the file as XHTML and close the Export dialog.
Notes
Writer does not replace multiple spaces in the original document with the HTML code  
for non-breaking spaces. To create extra spaces in a HTML file or web page, insert 
non-breaking spaces in LibreOffice. To enter non-breaking spaces, use the keyboard  
shortcut Ctrl+Spacebar (macOS ⌘+Shift+Spacebar ).
The Tab character is not rendered when LibreOffice exports to XHTML. Instead, use 
borderless tables to position contents instead of the Tab character in a line. You will 
have to change the bullet and number lists that insert a Tab character between the 
bullet or number and the text—instead, create a list style where the Tab character is 
replaced by a space.
Objects that are different from usual image formats are not rendered in LibreOffice 
XHTML output. This includes drawings, spreadsheets, charts, and OLE objects in 
general. To render an OLE object in XHTML, replace the document’s OLE object with  
an image of the OLE object.
Saving document as a series of web pages
Writer can save a large document as a series of web pages (HTML files) with a table of contents 
page. To this, follow these steps:
1) Decide which heading style in a document starts a new page and make sure all those 
headings have the same paragraph style, for example, Heading 1.
2) Go to File > Send > Create HTML Document  on the Menu bar and open the Name and 
Path of the HTML Document dialog (Figure  326).
3) Navigate to the place where the HTML file is going to be saved.
4) Enter a file name in the File name: text box.
5) Select HTML Document from options available from the File type:.
6) In separated by:, select the style from the drop-down list that is going to create a new 
page in the HTML file, for example Heading 1.
7) Click on Save to create the multi-page HTML document and close the dialog. The HTML 
files created conform to the HTML 4.0 Transitional standard.
392 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 326: Name and Path of the HTML Document dialog
Spreadsheets
Calc can save spreadsheet files as HTML documents. If the file contains more than one sheet, 
the additional sheets follow each other in the HTML file. Links to each sheet are placed at the 
top of the HTML document. To do this task, perform the following steps:
1) If necessary, create a new folder as a location for the HTML file.
2) Open the Save As dialog by selecting File > Save As on the Menu bar.
3) Navigate to the required location in the Save As dialog.
4) Enter a file name for the HTML file in the File name: text box.
5) Select HTML Document (Calc) (.html)  in the File type: field.
6) Click on Save to save the file as HTML and close the Save As dialog.
7) If necessary, click on Use HTML Document (Calc) Format  in the Confirmation dialog 
that opens confirming the file is saved as HTML.
Note
Calc allows the insertion of links directly into a spreadsheet using the Hyperlink 
dialog. See Chapter 4, Working with Styles, Templates and Hyperlinks, for more 
information on hyperlinks.
Presentations and drawings
Exporting
Impress presentations and Draw drawings cannot properly be saved in HTML format, but can be  
exported as SVG documents with the Export command. To export a presentation or a drawing:
1) Select the slides or pages to export.
2) Open the Export dialog by selecting File > Export.
3) Navigate to the required location in the Export dialog.
Chapter 10  Working with File Formats, Security, and Exporting  | 3934) Select SVG – Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg)  in the File format list box.
5) Click on Export to export to SVG format and close the dialog.
The export SVG file contains the selected exported slides or drawing pages.
TIP
Most modern browsers can open and render SVG files. On a multi slide or page 
export, use the mouse wheel, mouse buttons, left and right arrows, Page Up and 
Page Down keys to scroll the slides or pages. You can use the browser zoom 
keyboard and mouse combination to enlarge or shrink the exported images. Most 
modern browsers also have a full-screen mode suitable to display the exported page  
as in a slide show.
Note
The SVG export preserves slide transition and object animation.
HTML files using Writer/Web
LibreOffice Writer has a configuration called Writer/Web that can create, edit, and save files in 
HTML format. Writer/Web is only available when working with documents that are in HTML 
format.
Display modes
By default, Writer/Web opens an HTML file in Normal view (Figure 327). To change Writer/Web 
to Web view, go to View > Web on the Menu bar (Figure  328). If necessary, Normal or Web 
view are used to add to an HTML document, then edit and format the contents of the HTML 
document. The contents in an HTML document are rendered as if displayed in a browser.
Figure 327: Example of Normal view in Writer/Web
394 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 328: Example of Web view in Writer/Web
Writer/Web can also display the source code of an HTML document. Go to View > HTML 
Source on the Menu bar to open the source code display for an HTML document (Figure  329). 
The HTML Source display mode is used to change the formatting and page elements of a web 
page. Using this display mode for editing requires familiarity and knowledge of the HTML markup  
language. 
Figure 329: Example of HTML Source view in Writer/Web
Notes
HTML markup language has fewer formatting options than a ODF text document. 
Writer/Web does not provide all formatting features for HTML documents and some 
formatting dialogs have fewer options available. For example, a HTML paragraph 
has no tab settings.
Chapter 10  Working with File Formats, Security, and Exporting  | 395HTML markup content generated by Writer/Web is limited to the elements used to 
produce a displayable document in a web browser. It does not contain other 
components of a website such as external cascading style sheets (CSS), external 
JavaScript, or other script languages. When you manually insert links to any external  
components into the web page, you must do it in HTML Source display mode. 
Creating and editing
To create an HTML document, do the following:
1) Select File > New > HTML Document  and Writer/Web opens a blank document in Web 
display mode (Figure  328).
2) Add content to the document by typing or pasting text, images, tables, and other objects.
3) Use all the formatting resources available in Writer/Web, including the capability to edit 
and format the content in styles.
4) When all editing is complete, go to File > Save As on the Menu bar and save the 
document in the HTML file type.
5) Preview the HTML document in a browser to make sure it has rendered correctly.
Editing source code
To edit the source code of an HTML document:
1) Open or create an HTML document.
2) Open HTML source view (Figure  329) using one of the following methods:
– Go to View > HTML Source  on the Menu bar.
– Click on HTML source on the Standard toolbar.
3) Add, or edit the HTML source code.
4) When all editing is complete, go to File > Save As on the Menu bar and save the 
document as HTML file type.
5) Preview the HTML document in a browser to make sure it renders correctly.
Previewing HTML documents
It is important to preview HTML documents in a web browser to make sure it displays correctly. 
Since not all browsers render HTML files the same way, you should preview an HTML document 
in several browsers.
To make LibreOffice open the default web browser and display an HTML document, use one of 
the following methods:
• Go to File > Preview in Web Browser  on the Menu bar.
• Click Preview in Web Browser  on the Standard toolbar.
• Open the web browser and then open the HTML file in the browser.
Writer/Web options
Go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice Writer/Web  (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > 
LibreOffice Writer/Web ) on the Menu bar to open the Options LibreOffice Writer/Web dialog 
(Figure 330), and then you can define the basic settings for LibreOffice documents in HTML 
format. For more information on the options available for Writer/Web, go to the LibreOffice Help 
website.
396 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 330: Options LibreOffice Writer/Web dialog
Click on a tab in the dialog to access the available options. The tabbed pages are as follows:
View
Defines the default settings for displaying objects in text documents and also the default 
settings for the window elements.
Formatting Aids
Defines the LibreOffice text and HTML documents’ display for certain characters and for 
the direct cursor.
Grid
Specifies the settings for the configurable grid for document pages. This grid helps to 
determine the exact position of objects. Also, this grid can be set to align with the snap 
grid in LibreOffice.
Print
Specifies print settings within a text or HTML document.
Table
Defines the attributes of tables in text documents.
Background
Specifies the background for HTML documents. The background is valid for creating new  
HTML documents and for HTML documents already created. Any created HTML 
documents must not have a background defined to use this option.
Chapter 10  Working with File Formats, Security, and Exporting  | 397Emailing documents
LibreOffice has multiple ways to send documents as email attachments in one of three formats 
— Open Document Format (LibreOffice default format); Microsoft Office format; Portable 
Document Format.
1) Go to File > Send on the Menu bar and use one of the following options:
– Email Document — The default email program is opened and the document is 
attached to the email message.
– Email as OpenDocument text  — The default email program is opened and the 
document is attached to the email message.
– Email as Microsoft Word  — LibreOffice creates a file in Microsoft Word format, 
opens the default email program, and the document is attached to the email message.
– Email as PDF — First, the PDF Options dialog opens. Next, select the required 
settings required and click OK. LibreOffice will open the default email program with the  
PDF file attached to the email message.
2) Enter the recipient name, subject, and message, then send the email.
Note
The above procedure is for sending text documents as an attachment to an email. 
When sending spreadsheets, presentations, or drawings, the email options change 
to reflect the type of document being attached to an email message.
Files on remote servers
LibreOffice can open and save files stored on remote servers. Keeping files on remote servers 
allows access to documents using different computers. For example, working on a document in 
the office during the day and edit the same document at home for last-minute changes. Storing 
files on a remote server also backs up documents from computer loss or hard disk failure. Some 
remote servers can also check-in and check-out files controlling usage and access for 
documents.
LibreOffice supports many document servers that use well known network protocols such as 
FTP, WebDav, Windows share, and SSH. It also supports popular services like Google Drive and  
Microsoft OneNote, as well as commercial and open source servers that implement the OASIS 
CMIS standard.
Access a remote server connection as follows. The following procedure is an example only. 
Actual procedure depends on operating system, computer setup and type of remote file service 
selected.
1) Open the Remote Files dialog (Figure  331) using one of the following methods:
– Click on Remote Files in the LibreOffice Start Center.
– Select File > Open Remote  on the Menu bar.
– Select File > Save Remote  on the Menu bar.
2) Click on Manage Services, and select Add service to open the File Services dialog 
(Figure 332).
398 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 331: Remote Files dialog
Figure 332: File Services dialog
3) Select the type of file service required from options available in the Type drop-down list. 
Depending on the file service selected, different parameters are necessary for 
connection to a remote server.
4) Enter the necessary information in the text boxes. The text boxes change depending on 
the type of service that has been selected in Type.
5) If necessary, enter a label for the remote server in the Label text box.
6) Click on OK to save the details and close the File Services dialog.
7) In the Remote Files dialog, select the service from the Service drop-down list.
8) Navigate to where the remote file is located and select the required file.
9) Click on Open to open the file and close the Remote Files dialog.
Digital signatures
To sign a file digitally, a personal key, also known as a certificate, is required. This personal key 
is stored on the computer being used as a combination of a private key, which must be kept 
secret, and a public key. These keys are added to a drawing when a digital signature is applied. 
A certificate is obtained from a certification authority, which may be a private company or a 
government institution.
When a digital signature is applied to a document, a checksum is computed from the document 
content, plus the personal key being used. The checksum and public key are stored together 
with the document.
Chapter 10  Working with File Formats, Security, and Exporting  | 399When the document is opened on another computer with a recent version of LibreOffice, the 
program computes the checksum again and compares it with the stored checksum. If both 
checksums are the same, the program opens the original, unchanged document.
In addition, the program can display the public key information from the certificate. This 
information can then be compared with the public key that is published on the web site of the 
certificate authority. Whenever a document is changed, this change breaks the digital signature.
For more information on digital signatures, see “About Digital Signatures” and “Applying Digital 
Signatures” on the LibreOffice Help website.
Applying digital signatures
This is a sample method for digitally signing a document in LibreOffice. Your actual procedure 
depends on how your computer is  set up and what operating system is being used.
1) Go to File > Digital Signatures > Digital Signatures  on the Menu bar and open the 
Digital Signatures dialog (Figure  333) that lists the available digital signatures for the 
document.

2) If a message box opens advising to save the document, click on Yes to save the 
document.
3) If necessary, click on Sign Document to open the Select Certificate dialog (Figure  334).
Figure 334: Select Certificate dialog
4) Select the required digital signature in the Select Certificate dialog.
5) Click on Sign to apply the digital signature to the document and close the Select 
Certificate dialog.
400 |Getting Started 24.86) In the Digital Signatures dialog, select the required digital signature from the signature 
list.
7) Click on Close to apply the selected digital signature to the document and close the 
Digital Signatures dialog.
8) Go to File > Save on the Menu bar to save the document.
Notes
A signed document displays a Digital Signature icon in the Status Bar. Double -click 
on this Digital Signature icon to view the certificate. More than one digital signature 
can be added to a document.
Changing an existing description invalidates a digital signature. However, multiple 
digital signatures from the same author are allowed, because each digital signature 
can have a different description.
Signature line
Graphic boxes, that includes a signature line, can also be added to a document. This allows the 
user to optionally sign a document with their signature. This option is only available for Writer 
and Calc documents.
Add a graphic signature box to a Writer, or Calc document as follows:
1) Go to Insert > Signature Line  on the Menu bar to open the Signature Line dialog 
(Figure 335).
2) Enter the necessary details and select the required options.
3) Click OK to close the Signature Line dialog and a graphic box with a signature line is 
inserted into the document. An example is shown in Figure  336.
Figure 335: Signature Line dialog

size and the fonts are used on the target computer for better rendering of the document 
layout.
Consider embedding fonts when a document use rare, or custom fonts not generally 
available in other computers.
Note
Font licenses may restrict embedding fonts in documents. Font files contain flags 
that indicate if and how they can be embedded within a document file. LibreOffice 
parses these flags and determines if and how it may be embedded in a document 
file. When opening a document containing embedded fonts, LibreOffice looks at 
these flags to determine if and how a document can be viewed or edited.
Font scripts to embed
Select which types of fonts are embedded: Latin, Asian, Complex.
Statistics
Displays statistics for the current file, for example number of pages, words, and characters.
Document classification
Document classification and security is an important issue for businesses and governments. 
LibreOffice has implemented the open standards produced by TSCP (Transglobal Secure 
Collaboration Participation, Inc.) containing three BAF (Business Authentication Framework) 
categories: Intellectual Property, National Security and Export Control with each category having 
four BAILS (Business Authorization Identification and Labeling Scheme) levels: Non-Business, 
General Business, Confidential, and Internal Only.
While this standard has been developed with the intent that it would be applicable in any domain  
of activity, LibreOffice retained the aerospace and defense industry nomenclature and 
categories, where sensitivity marking results from national security, export control and 
intellectual property policies.
To enable document classification, go to View > Toolbars > TSCP Classification  on the Menu 
bar to open the TSCP toolbar. This toolbar contains list boxes helping in selection of security for 
a document. LibreOffice then adds custom fields in the document properties ( File > Properties, 
Custom Properties  on the Menu bar) to store the classification policy as document metadata.
To prevent a breach in security policy, contents with a higher classification level cannot be 
pasted into documents with a lower classification level.
Business Authentication Framework (BAF) Categories
The default BAF categories for LibreOffice are listed below.
Intellectual Property
Select this category for general purpose document classification.
406 |Getting Started 24.8Tip
The Intellectual Properties  category modifies the layout of a document with a 
watermark, fields in the header and footer and an information bar on top of the 
document area. Each item inserted in the document is controlled by the classification  
configuration file.
National Security
Selecting this category assigns the national security policy type to the document. The 
selected category is saved together with the document as BAILS metadata in the file 
properties and no modifications are carried in the document layout or the user interface.
Export Control
Selects this category assigns the export control policy type to the document. The 
selected category is saved together with the document as BAILS metadata in the file 
properties and no modifications are carried in the document layout or the user interface.
Note
Refer to the corporate data security policy and information security officers for 
support in document classification.
Default levels of classification
LibreOffice provides default levels of document classification (BAILS) shown below, sorted by 
increasing level of business sensitivity:
Non-Business
Information in document has no impact in business, if made public.
General Business
Minor impact. Information has impact in business, can generate embarrassments, minor 
damage in brand image, if made public.
Confidential
Modest impact. Information disclosed can damage business brand, can generate 
negative media coverage and loss of revenue.
Internal use only
Major damage. Negative national media, lawsuits, fines, long term brand damages.
Customizing classification levels
LibreOffice allows users to customize the levels of classification for a business. To customize the  
number and the name of the levels, copy a file, for example example.xml, located in Tools > 
Options > LibreOffice > Paths > Classification  (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > 
LibreOffice > Paths > Classification ) into a local folder and edit the contents. Save the file and  
make the required changes to the classification path to access the file.
Pasting contents
Pasting contents in documents with different levels of classification prevents a breach in the 
security policy, contents with high classification level pasted to documents with lower 
classification level are not allowed. LibreOffice displays a warning message wherever it detects 
that the contents of the clipboard have higher security classification than the target document.

Ctrl-click required to follow hyperlinks
If enabled, hold down the Ctrl key (macOS ) while clicking a hyperlink to open the ⌘
link. If not enabled, a click opens the hyperlink.
Block any links from documents not among the trusted locations (see Macro Security)
Blocks the use of linked images by documents not in the trusted locations defined in 
Trusted Sources of the Macro Security dialog. This can increase security if working with  
documents from untrusted sources (for example the internet) and are worried about 
vulnerabilities in image processing software components. Blocking the use of links 
means that images are not loaded in untrusted documents, only a placeholder frame is 
visible.
Redaction
LibreOffice documents can be redacted to remove, or hide, any sensitive information allowing 
selective disclosure of information in a document while keeping other parts of the document 
secret. When a LibreOffice document is redacted, it is exported as a new PDF file with all the 
redacted portions removed and replaced by redaction blocks of pixels preventing any attempt to 
restore or copy the original contents. A redacted document is exported in PDF format for 
publication, or sharing.
A copy of any documents redacted in LibreOffice Writer, Calc, or Impress are automatically 
transferred to LibreOffice Draw where the redaction is carried out.
Chapter 10  Working with File Formats, Security, and Exporting  | 409Redaction tools
The tools available on the Redaction toolbar (Figure  341) are as follows:
Rectangle Redaction
Used to mark the content for redaction by drawing transparent rectangles covering the 
content. Use the handles to resize the redaction rectangle.
Freeform Redaction
Allows the user to mark the content for redaction by drawing free-form lines, or polygons 
covering the content.
Redacted Export (Black)
Converts the semi-transparent redaction shape to opaque black and exports as pixels in 
the PDF file.
Redacted Export (White)
Converts the semi-transparent redaction shapes to opaque white shapes and exports as 
pixels in the PDF file.
Export Preview PDF
Makes a copy of the presentation as a PDF file to preview the redaction areas before 
making a redacted PDF file of the presentation.
Figure 341: Redaction toolbar
Documents, spreadsheets, or presentations
A copy of a document, spreadsheet, or presentation is automatically transferred to LibreOffice 
Draw where the redaction is carried out.
1) Open the document to be redacted in LibreOffice Writer, Calc or Impress, then go to 
Tools > Redact on the Menu bar and the following happens:
– The document is copied, prepared and transferred to LibreOffice Draw as an untitled 
file.
– LibreOffice Draw opens with the untitled document displayed.
– The Redaction toolbar automatically opens. If the Redaction toolbar is not displayed, 
go to View > Toolbars on the Menu bar in LibreOffice Draw and select Redaction.
2) Go to Tools > Redact on the Menu bar and click on Rectangle Redaction  or Freeform 
Redaction in the Redaction toolbar.
3) Draw the required shapes to redact the sensitive areas in the document. The redaction 
shape is gray allowing the sensitive areas in the document to be visible before they are 
redacted.
4) If necessary, click on Export Preview PDF  to create a preview copy of the PDF file to 
review the redaction areas before it is finalized.
5) If necessary, delete the PDF copy after reviewing the redaction areas in the file.
6) Click on Redacted Export (White) , or Redacted Export (Black)  in the Redaction 
toolbar to export the presentation file as a redacted PDF file.
410 |Getting Started 24.87) Navigate to the folder in the file browser window that opens where the redact PDF file is 
going to be saved and enter a name for the file.
8) Click on Save to create the redacted PDF file. The gray redaction shapes are converted 
to white, or black shapes and the document is exported as a PDF
Drawings
Open a drawing file in Draw, then use Steps 2) through 8) in “ Documents, spreadsheets, or 
presentations” above to create a redacted PDF copy of the drawing file.
Note
When a redacted document is exported as a new PDF file, any redacted areas are 
removed from the new document and replaced by redacted blocks of pixels. These 
blocks of pixels prevent any attempt to restore, or copying the original contents that 
have been redacted.
Automatic redaction
When LibreOffice conducts automatic redaction, it allows the user to define words and patterns 
that are automatically marked for redaction. Automatic redaction is useful for documents that 
have multiple occurrences of names and other personal information (for example credit cards, 
phone numbers, and so on). Manually redacting this type information in a document would 
require significant effort, but automatic redaction makes redaction of a document easier and 
more efficient.
Creating targets
Targets are rules and patterns used by automatic redaction to find words and information in a 
document that are to be marked for automatic redaction.
Figure 342: Automatic Redaction dialog
1) Open a document and use Tools > Auto-Redact  on the Menu bar to open the Automatic  
Redaction dialog (Figure  342).
2) Click on Add Target to open the Add Target dialog (Figure  343).
3) Enter a target name in the Name text box.
4) Select a target type from the available options in the Type drop-down list.

– Text — automatic redaction looks for all occurrences of the specified text and marks 
them for redaction.
– Regular expression  — define a regular expression for searching in a document. All 
matches are marked for redaction.
– Predefined — select predefined regular expressions for automatic redaction, such as 
credit card numbers, email addresses and so on.
5) Enter the content in the Content text box.
6) If necessary, select the options Match case and Whole words only  to help define which  
targets are auto-redacted.
7) Click OK to close the Add Target dialog and the target is added to the Redaction 
Targets list in the Automatic Redaction dialog.
8) Repeat Steps 2 through 7 above until all targets required have been added to the

6) Print the document, or export the document as a PDF file.
Note
The automatic redaction targets are saved in a document. The targets are available 
after the document is saved and closed.
Password protection and OpenPGP encryption
LibreOffice provides two types of document protection: password protection and OpenPGP 
encryption.
• Files encrypted with the Save password option  enabled cannot be decrypted without 
the password.
• Files encrypted with OpenPGP encryption, the document is encrypted using an 
algorithm, which requires a key. Each key is used only once and is sent to the recipient 
along with the document.
Password protection
LibreOffice provides two levels of password protection: 
• The document file cannot be opened without entering a password.
• The document cannot be edited until a second password is entered.
The two options above make a document available for reading by one group of people and for 
reading and editing by a different group. This is compatible with Microsoft Word file protection.
Adding passwords
1) Go to File > Save As on the Menu bar to open the Save as dialog.
2) Navigate to the folder where the file is going to be saved.
3) If necessary, enter a file name in the File name text box and select the file type from the 
available options in the File type drop-down list.
4) Select the Save with password  option, then click on Save to open the Set Password 
dialog (Figure 344).
5) In File Encryption Password , enter a password to open the document and then enter 
the same password as confirmation. Passwords are case sensitive. A color password 
strength meter appears below the password box, where red is for weak passwords, 
yellow is just a bit better, blue is even better and green is a secure password.
6) Click on Options to open File Sharing Password .
7) Select Open file read-only  to prevent any editing being carried out on the document.
8) To allow editing of the document, enter a password in Enter password to allow editing  
and repeat the password as confirmation.
9) Click OK and the Set Password dialog closes and the file is saved with password 
protection.
Chapter 10  Working with File Formats, Security, and Exporting  | 413Figure 344: Set Password dialog
Notes
 If the passwords match, the document is saved password protected. If either the 
passwords do not match, an error message is displayed.
LibreOffice uses a very strong encryption mechanism that makes it almost 
impossible to recover the contents of a document if the password is lost or forgotten.
Changing passwords
When a document is password protected, the password can be changed while the document is 
open.
1) Go to File > Properties > General  on the Menu bar to open the Properties dialog.
2) Click on Change Password  to open the Set Password dialog.
3) Enter a new password to open the file and to allow editing of the document.
4) Click OK to close the Set Password dialog.
5) Click OK again to close the Properties dialog.
OpenPGP encryption
LibreOffice can encrypt documents confidentially using OpenPGP. The document is encrypted 
using a symmetric encryption algorithm, which requires a symmetric key. Each symmetric key is 
used only once and is also called a session key. The document and its session key are sent to 
the recipient. The session key must be sent to the recipients so they know how to decrypt the 
document. To protect the document during transmission, it is encrypted with the public key 
belonging to the recipient. Only the private key belonging to the recipient can decrypt the 
session key. For more information on using OpenPGP encryption, go to the LibreOffice Help 
website.
414 |Getting Started 24.8LibreOffice uses the OpenPGP software installed on a computer. If no OpenPGP software is 
available, download and install OpenPGP software that is compatible with the computer 
operating system before using OpenPGP encryption.
A personal pair of cryptography keys must be defined using the OpenPGP software. Refer to the  
OpenPGP software installed on how to create a pair of keys. 
OpenPGP encryption requires the use of the public key belonging to the recipient. This key must  
be available in the OpenPGP key chain stored in the computer.
The following is an example of how to use OpenPGP encryption on a document:
1) Set the preferred public key for OpenPGP encryption and digital signature. This preferred  
key is pre-selected in the key selection dialog each time a document is signed or 
encrypted. This removes the requirement to select the preferred key when frequently 
signing a document with one specific key.
2) Go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > User Data  (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences 
> LibreOffice > User Data ) on the Menu bar and select the following options in the 
Cryptography section:
– OpenPGP signing key  — select an OpenPGP key from the drop-down list for signing 
ODF documents.
– OpenPGP encryption key  — select an OpenPGP key from the drop-down list for 
encrypting ODF documents.
– When encrypting documents, always encrypt to self  — select this option to also 
encrypt the file with a public key, allowing the document to be opened with a private 
key.
Caution
Keep this option selected to allow decryption of documents that have been encrypted  
for other people. If not selected, you will not be able to decrypt your own files.
3) Go to File > Save As on the Menu bar to open the Save as dialog.
4) Navigate to the required location for the file, then enter a file name and file type in the 
Save as dialog.
5) Select Encrypt with GPG key  option and click on Save to open the Select X.509 
Certificate dialog.
6) Select the public key for the recipient. Multiple keys can be selected.
7) Click Encrypt to close the dialog and save the file encrypted with the selected public 
keys.

Chapter 11, 
Getting Started with Macros
Using the Macro Recorder … and BeyondIntroduction
A macro is a set of commands or keystrokes that are stored for later use. For example, a simple 
macro allows you to enter your address into an open document and a macro can automate both 
simple and complex tasks. Macros are very useful when you have to repeat the same task in the  
same way.
The simplest way to create a macro is to record a series of actions with LibreOffice’s user 
interface via the open source LibreOffice Basic scripting language (an implementation of the 
well-known BASIC programming language). These macros can be edited and enhanced after 
recording with the built-in LibreOffice Basic Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
The most powerful macros in LibreOffice can be created with one of the four supported scripting 
languages (LibreOffice Basic, Python, JavaScript, and BeanShell). This chapter provides an 
overview of LibreOffice’s macro facilities with an emphasis on its default macro scripting 
language, LibreOffice Basic. Though some introductory examples are included for the 
BeanShell, JavaScript, and Python scripting languages, an in-depth discussion on using these 
languages for scripting is beyond the scope of this chapter.
Your first macros
Adding a macro
To start with LibreOffice macros, we recommend that you find and use existing macros. We 
assumes that you have an existing macro that you want to use, which was originally found in a 
book or on the internet. In this example, the macro in Listing 1 is used. Once you have a macro, 
you create a library and module to contain your macro; the creation of a macro library is below, 
but see “Macro organization ” on page 478 for more information.
Listing 1: Simple macro that says hello
Sub HelloMacro
  Print "Hello"
End Sub
Use the following steps to create a library that will contain your macro:
1) Open any LibreOffice application.
2) Go to Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > Basic  to open the Basic Macros dialog 
(Figure 345).
Figure 345: Basic Macros dialog
418 |Getting Started 24.83) Click Organizer to open the Basic Macro Organizer dialog (Figure 346) and select the 
Libraries tab.
Figure 346: LibreOffice Basic Macro Organizer dialog, Libraries tab
4) Set the Location drop-down to My Macros & Dialogs , which is the default location.
5) Click New to open the New Library dialog (not shown here).
6) Enter a library name, for example TestLibrary, and click OK.
7) On the Basic Macro Organizer dialog, select the Modules tab (Figure 347).
Figure 347: Basic Macro Organizer dialog, Modules tab
Chapter 11,  Getting Started with Macros  | 4198) In the Module list, expand My Macros and select your library (in the example, 
TestLibrary). A module named Module1 already exists and can contain your macro. If you  
wish, you can click New to create another module in the library.
9) Select Module1, or the new module that you created, and click Edit to open the 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (Figure 348). The IDE is a text editor and 
associated facilities that are built into LibreOffice and allow you to create, edit, run, and 
debug macros.
10) When a new module is created, it contains a comment and an empty macro named 
Main, which does nothing.
11) If you are ready, add the new macro either before Sub Main or after End Sub. Listing 2 
shows the new macro added before Sub Main.
Figure 348: LibreOffice Basic IDE (Integrated Development Environment) window
Listing 2: Module1 after adding the new macro
REM  *****  BASIC  *****
Sub HelloMacro
  Print "Hello"
End Sub
Sub Main
End Sub
Tip
If you prefer, you can remove the Sub Main … End Sub code from the Module and 
leave only the HelloMacro subroutine.
420 |Getting Started 24.812) (Optional) To check if the macro is written as expected by the LibreOffice Basic 
programming language, click the Compile icon on the Macro toolbar.
13) Double-click the HelloMacro subroutine in the Object Catalog window under 
TestLibrary > Module 1  and click the Run icon on the Macro toolbar, or press the F5 key, 
to run the HelloMacro subroutine in the module. A small dialog will open with the word 
“Hello” displayed (see below).
Figure 349: Dialog with results of the Print instruction.
14) Click OK to close this small dialog.
15) If no subroutine or function is selected, a dialog like the one in Figure 350 will open. Then 
select the macro and click Run to execute it.
16) To select and run any macro in the module, click the Select Macro icon on the Standard 
toolbar or go to Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > Basic .
17) Select a macro and then click Run.
Figure 350: Dialog to select and run a macro
Chapter 11,  Getting Started with Macros  | 421Recording a macro
When you record a macro in LibreOffice, you are actually  using programming language to 
record the steps needed to perform a certain task. For example, if you have to repeatedly enter 
the same information into a document, you can create a macro that automatically enters this 
piece of information without having to copy it every time you need it.
Note
Sometimes, it might be better to create an AutoText that can repeatedly enter 
information into a document. See Chapter 2, Working with Text: Basics, in the Writer 
Guide for more information.
First enable macro recording in LibreOffice by going to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > 
Advanced and selecting the option Enable macro recording  under Optional Features. By 
default, this feature is turned off in LibreOffice.
1) Go to Tools > Macros > Record Macro  to start recording a macro. A small dialog with a 
Stop Recording button is displayed indicating that LibreOffice is recording a macro.
2) Type the desired text you want to be entered when this macro is run. As an example, 
type your name.
3) Click Stop Recording on the small dialog. This will cause Basic Macros dialog to open 
(similar to Figure 345 on page 465, but with different action buttons).
4) Open the library container My Macros.
5) Find the library named Standard in My Macros. Note that every library container has a 
library named Standard.
6) Select the Standard library and then choose an existing module in which to save the 
macro. Alternatively you can click New Module to create a new module to contain the 
newly recorded macro.
7) In the Macro Name text box at the top left section of the dialog, type a name for the 
macro you have just recorded, for example EnterMyName.
8) Click Save to save the macro and close the Basic Macros dialog.
If you followed all of the above steps, a macro named EnterMyName will have been created 
inside the selected module.
Note
Whenever you create a new module in LibreOffice, a subroutine named Main is 
automatically added to the module.
Running a macro
1) Go to Tools > Macros > Run Macro  to open the Macro Selector dialog (Figure 351).
2) For example, select your newly created macro EnterMyName and click Run.
3) Alternatively, go to Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > Basic  to open the Basic 
Macros dialog (Figure 345), select your macro and click Run.
422 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 351: Use the Macro Selector dialog to select and run an existing macro
Viewing and editing macros
To view and edit the macro that you created:
1) Go to Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > Basic  to open the Basic Macros dialog.
2) Select your new macro EnterMyName and click Edit. The Basic IDE will open and the 
macro EnterMyName will be shown as in Listing 3.
This first macro is not complicated (see Listing 3):
Listing 3: Code recorded for the EnterMyname macro
sub EnterMyName
rem -------------------------------------------------------------
rem define variables
dim document   as object
dim dispatcher as object
rem -------------------------------------------------------------
rem get access to the document
document   = ThisComponent.CurrentController .Frame
dispatcher = createUnoService("com.sun.star.frame.DispatchHelper" )
rem -------------------------------------------------------------
dim args1(0) as new com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue
args1(0).Name = "Text"
args1(0).Value = "Your name"
dispatcher.executeDispatch(document, ".uno:InsertText" , "", 0, args1())
end sub
Commenting with REM
All comments in Basic macro coding begin with REM, which stands for remark. All text on a line 
that begins with REM is ignored by the Basic interpreter when the macro is run.
Chapter 11,  Getting Started with Macros  | 423Tip
As a shortcut, you can use the single quote character (') to start a comment.
LibreOffice Basic is not case-sensitive for keywords, so REM, Rem, and rem can all start a 
comment. If you use symbolic constants defined by the Application Programming Interface (API),  
it is safer to assume that the names are case-sensitive. It is worth noting that symbolic constants  
are an advanced topic that is not covered by this user guide and they are not required when 
using the macro recorder in LibreOffice.
Defining subroutines with SUB
Individual macros are stored in subroutines and these subroutines begin with the keyword SUB. 
The end of a subroutine is indicated by the words END SUB. The code starts by defining the 
subroutine named Main, which is empty and does nothing. Note that the code in Listing 3 for the 
EnterMyName macro starts with the keyword SUB and ends with END SUB.
There are advanced topics that are beyond the scope of this user guide, but knowing about them  
might be of interest:
• You can write subroutines that accept input values to be used inside the macro. These 
values are called arguments. This can only be done when you create subroutines from 
scratch. Recorded macros in LibreOffice do not accept arguments.
• Another kind of subroutine is called a function, which is a subroutine that can return a 
value as a result of its work. Functions are defined by the keyword FUNCTION at the 
beginning. Recorded macros in LibreOffice create subroutines only.
Defining variables using DIM
When you are defining a variable (which contains data), you should use the DIM keyword, which 
was originally stood for Dimension and was used to define the dimensions of an array. The DIM 
statement used in the EnterMyName macro is similar to setting aside a piece of paper to be used  
to store a message or note.
In the EnterMyName macro, the variables document and dispatcher are defined as the type 
object. Other common variable types include string, integer, and date. A third variable, named 
args1, is an array of property values. A variable of type array allows a single variable to contain 
multiple values, similar to storing multiple pages in a single book. Values in an array usually 
begin at zero. The number in the parentheses indicates the highest usable number to access a 
storage location. In this example, there is only one value, and it is numbered zero.
Explaining macro code
The following is an explanation of the code used in the EnterMyName macro. 
sub EnterMyName
Defines the start of the EnterMyName macro.
dim document as object
Defines document as an object variable. Objects are a specific variable type with 
multiple fields (sometimes they are called properties) and actions (also they are called 
methods). The fields can be perceived like variables (including an object) and actions like  
subroutines which allow us to operate with the object.
Note
Sometimes the word service is used. A service is supplied by an object when a 
macro commands it via an object’s method.
424 |Getting Started 24.8dim dispatcher as object
Defines dispatcher as an object variable.
document = ThisComponent.CurrentController .Frame
ThisComponent is a runtime object created by LibreOffice that refers to the current 
document.
CurrentController  is a property referring to a service that controls the document. For 
example, when you type, it is the current controller that takes note of what you type. 
CurrentController  then dispatches the changes to the document frame.
Frame is a controller property that returns the main frame for a document. Therefore, the 
variable named document refers to a document’s frame, which receives dispatched 
commands.
dispatcher = createUnoService("com.sun.star.frame.DispatchHelper" )
Most tasks in LibreOffice are accomplished by dispatching a command. LibreOffice 
includes a DispatchHelper service, which provides an easy way to dispatch a URL 
using one call instead of multiple ones and does most of the work when using dispatches  
in macros. The method CreateUnoService  accepts the name of a service and it tries to 
create an instance of that service. On completion, the dispatcher variable contains a 
reference to a DispatchHelper.
dim args1(0) as new com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue
Declares the args1 array of properties. Each property has a name and a value. In other 
words, it is a name/value pair. The created array has one property at index zero.
The com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue  expression is a Universal Network Objects 
(UNO) structure. Structures are special variable types that contain other variables united 
by logical basis. They can be convenient to operate with sets of heterogeneous 
information that should be treated as a single whole. 
NOTE
An explanation of UNO and user structures goes far beyond the scope of this book.  
For more information on creating and using structures, see the LibreOffice Help 
system and other Basic guides.
args1(0).Name = "Text"
args1(0).Value = "Your name"
Gives the property the name “Text” and the value “Your name”, which is the text that is 
inserted when the macro is run.
dispatcher.executeDispatch(document, ".uno:InsertText" , "", 0, args1())
The dispatch helper sends a dispatch to the document frame (stored in the variable 
document) with the command .uno:InsertText . The next two arguments, frame name 
and search flags, are beyond the scope of this book. The last argument is the array of 
property values to be used while executing the command InsertText.
In other words, this line of code executes the UNO command .uno:InsertText  passing 
the value “Your Name” as the “Text” parameter.
end sub
The last line of the code ends the subroutine.
Chapter 11,  Getting Started with Macros  | 425Creating a macro
When creating a macro, it is important to ask two questions before recording:
1) Can the task be written as a simple set of commands?
2) Can the steps be arranged so that the macro’s final command leaves the cursor ready 
for the next command? Or does it allow the user to return to entering text or data into the 
target document?
A more complex example of a macro
One common macro task is to copy rows and columns of data from a website and format them 
as a table in a text document. Typically this macro works as follows:
1) Copy the data from the website to the clipboard.
2) To avoid strange formatting and fonts, paste the text into a Writer document as 
unformatted text.
3) Reformat the text with tabs between columns so that it can be converted into a table 
using Table > Convert > Text to Table .
With the two questions above in mind, inspect the text to see you can record a macro that 
formats the text. As an example of copied data, consider the text copied from the API website 
describing the FontWeight constants (Figure 352). The first column in this example indicates a 
constant name and each name is followed by a space and a tab, and each line has two trailing 
spaces.
DONTKNOW The font weight is not specified/known.  
THIN specifies a 50% font weight.  
ULTRALIGHT specifies a 60% font weight.  
LIGHT specifies a 75% font weight.  
SEMILIGHT specifies a 90% font weight.  
NORMAL specifies a normal font weight.  
SEMIBOLD specifies a 110% font weight.  
BOLD specifies a 150% font weight.  
ULTRABOLD specifies a 175% font weight.  
BLACK specifies a 200% font weight.  
Figure 352: Example of copied data
In this example we will want the first column in the table to contain the numeric value of the font 
weight, the second column will contain the constant name, and the third column will hold the text  
description. This task can be accomplished easily for every row except for DONTKNOW and 
NORMAL, which do not contain a numeric value.
Below are the steps to record this macro using keystrokes and assuming that the cursor is at the  
beginning of the line with the text “THIN”.
1) Make sure macro recording is enabled by going to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > 
Advanced and selecting the option Enable macro recording . By default, this feature is 
turned off when LibreOffice is installed on your computer.
2) Go to Tools > Macros > Record Macro  to start recording.
3) Press Ctrl+Right Arrow  to move the cursor to the start of the word “specifies”.
4) Press Backspace twice to remove the tab and the space.
5) Press Tab to add the tab without the space after the constant name.
426 |Getting Started 24.86) Press Delete to delete the lower case “s” and then press Shift+S to add an upper case  
“S”.
7) Press Ctrl+Right Arrow  twice to move the cursor to the start of the number.
8) Press Ctrl+Shift+Right Arrow  to select and move the cursor before the % sign.
9) Press Ctrl+C to copy the selected text to the clipboard.
10) Press End to move the cursor to the end of the line.
11) Press Backspace twice to remove the two trailing spaces.
12) Press Home to move the cursor to the start of the line.
13) Press Ctrl+V to paste the selected number to the start of the line.
14) Pasting the value also pasted an extra space, so press Backspace to remove the extra 
space.
15) Press Tab to insert a tab between the number and the name.
16) Press Home to move to the start of the line.
17) Press Down Arrow to move to the next line.
18) Stop recording the macro and save the macro, see “ Recording a macro ” on page 469.
It takes much longer to read and write these steps than to actually record the macro. Work 
slowly and think about the steps as you do them. With practice you will learn how to organize the  
steps into macros that can be used to automate repetitive tasks.
The generated macro code in Listing 4 has been modified to contain the step numbers in the 
comments to match the steps discussed above.

428 |Getting Started 24.8To run this macro, place the cursor at the beginning of the line to which you want to apply the 
recorded steps. Then go to Tools > Macros > Run Macro,  select the CopyNumToCol1 macro 
and click Run. Figure 353 shows the original line and the resulting line after applying the macro.
Figure 353: Result of applying the recorded macro
Keep in mind that the steps described above will only work properly if the first line follows the 
format we assumed while creating the macro. If you run this macro on the “DONTKNOW” and 
“NORMAL” lines the results will not be as expected because these two lines have different 
formats. Figure 354 shows the original line starting with “DONTKNOW”.
Figure 354: Result of using the macro in a line with a different structure
Running a macro quickly
Since it is not convenient to repeatedly run macros using Tools > Macros > Run Macro , you 
can assign a keyboard shortcut to quickly trigger it. To assign the shortcut Ctrl+K to the 
CopyNumToCol1 macro, do the following:
1) Go to Tools > Customize . This will open the Customize dialog.
2) Select the Keyboard tab. In the Shortcut Keys section, select the Ctrl+K shortcut.
3) In the Category section, select LibreOffice macros . Navigate this section and select the 
CopyNumToCol1 macro.
4) Now click the Assign button to assign the Ctrl+K shortcut to the CopyNumToCol1 
macro.
5) Click OK to close the Customize dialog.
Now you can run the CopyNumToCol1 macro using the Ctrl+K shortcut. This is very fast and 
easy to configure after you get used to the macro workflow. Figure 355 illustrates the steps 
involved.
Chapter 11,  Getting Started with Macros  | 429Figure 355: Assigning a shortcut to a macro
Limitations of the macro recorder
Unfortunately, the Macro Recorder cannot record some actions, and its limitations are related to 
LibreOffice’s dispatch framework and its relationship to the macro recorder.
Understanding the dispatch framework
The purpose of the dispatch framework is to provide uniform access to components (documents)  
for commands that generally correspond to menu items. It translates File > Save, the shortcut 
keys Ctrl+S, or clicking the Save icon on the Standard toolbar into the same “dispatch 
command.”
Also, the dispatch framework can send “commands” back to the user interface (UI). For 
example, after saving a new document, the framework makes sure that the list of recent files is 
updated.
A dispatch command is text, for example .uno:InsertObject  or .uno:GoToStartOfLine . The 
command is sent to the document frame and the frame the command around the API until an 
object is found that can handle the command.
How the macro recorder uses the dispatch framework
The macro recorder can only register commands generated by the dispatch framework, but not 
all dispatched commands are complete. For example, inserting an object generates the following  
code:
dispatcher.executeDispatch(document, ".uno:InsertObject" , "", 0, Array())
It is not possible to specify what kind of object to create or insert. If an object is inserted from a 
file, you cannot specify which file to insert.
430 |Getting Started 24.8If while recording a macro you use Tools > Options to open and modify configuration items, the 
generated macro does not record any configuration changes. In fact, the generated code is 
commented so it will not even be run.
rem dispatcher.executeDispatch(document, ".uno:OptionsTreeDialog", "", 0, Array())
Though a command is generated when you open a dialog, any work done inside the dialog is not  
usually recorded. This occurs in places like macro organization dialogs, when you are inserting 
special characters, and similar types of dialogs. Other possible problems using the macro 
recorder can occure when you insert a formula, set user data, create filters in Calc, do actions in 
database forms, and export a document to an encrypted PDF file. You never know for certain 
what the macro recorder can capture until you try it. For example, the actions from the search 
dialog are properly captured.
Other options
When the macro recorder is not able to solve a specific problem, normally the next steo is to 
write actual code using the LibreOffice objects. Unfortunately, there is a steep learning curve for 
these LibreOffice objects. It is usually best to start with simple examples and then increase the 
scope of macros as you learn more. Learning to read generated macros is a good place to start.
Macro organization
In LibreOffice, macros are grouped in modules, modules are grouped in libraries, and libraries 
are grouped in library containers. A library is usually used as a major grouping for either an 
entire category of macros, or for an entire application. Modules usually split functionality, such as  
user interaction and calculations. Individual macros are subroutines and functions. Figure 356 
shows an example of the hierarchical structure of macro libraries in LibreOffice.
Figure 356: Macro Library hierarchy
Go to Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > Basic  to open the Basic Macros dialog (Figure  
345 on page 465). All available library containers are shown in the Macro From list and every 
document is a library container, capable of containing multiple libraries. The application itself 
acts as two library containers, one container for macros distributed with LibreOffice called 
LibreOffice Macros , and one container for personal macros called My Macros.
The LibreOffice Macros  are stored with the application runtime code, which may not be editable 
to you unless you have administrator rights in LO. This helps protect these macros because they  
Chapter 11,  Getting Started with Macros  | 431should not be changed and you should not store your own macros in the LibreOffice Macros  
container.
Unless your macros are only applicable to a single document, your macros will probably be 
stored in the My Macros container. The My Macros container is stored in your user area or home  
directory.
If a macro is contained in a document, then a recorded macro will attempt to work on that 
document, because it primarily uses ThisComponent for its actions.
Every library container contains a library named Standard. We strongly recommend that you  
create your own libraries with meaningful names instead of using the Standard library. Libraries 
with meaningful names are easier to manage and unlike Standard, your own libraries can be 
imported into other library containers.
Caution
While LibreOffice allows you to import libraries into a library container, it will not allow  
you to overwrite the library named Standard. Therefore, if you store your macros in 
the Standard library, you cannot import them into another library container.
Just as it makes good sense to give your libraries meaningful names, you should use meaningful  
names for your modules. By default, LibreOffice uses names such as Module1, Module2, and so 
on.
As you create your macros, you must decide where to store them. Macros stored in the 
application library container named My Macros are globally available to all documents and 
storing a macro in a document is useful if the document will be shared and you want the macro 
to be included with the document. 
While the Standard and Template libraries are automatically loaded, other library macros are not 
available until the library that contains them is loaded.  A loaded library is displayed differently 
from a library that is not loaded. To load the library and the modules it contains, double-click on 
the library.
Where are macros stored?
LibreOffice stores user-specific data in a folder inside the user’s home directory. The location is 
operating system specific. To find out where configuration data is stored, go to Tools > Options 
> LibreOffice > Paths . User macros written in Basic are stored in LibreOffice\4\user\
basic. Each library is stored in its own directory inside the basic directory.
For casual use, it is not necessary to understand where macros are stored. If you know where 
they are stored, however, you can create a backup, share your macros, or inspect them if there 
is an error.
Exporting macros
If you want to export macro libraries so that they can be reused and shared with other people, 
use the  LibreOffice Basic Macro Organizer. To export a macro library:
1) Go to Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > Basic  and the click the Organizer button.
2) Click the Libraries tab and choose which library you want to export.
3) Click Export and then select Export as BASIC Library  (note that you cannot export the 
Standard library).
4) Choose where you want to save the library and click Save.
432 |Getting Started 24.8When a library is exported, LibreOffice creates a folder containing all files related to the library. 
Figure 357 shows an example of how a library named TestLibrary with a single module called 
Module1 would be exported.
Figure 357: Folder containing the exported library
Importing macros
The LibreOffice Basic Macro Organizer dialog allows you to import macro libraries into your 
document as well as creating, deleting, and renaming libraries, modules, and dialogs.
1) On the Libraries tab, select the library container to use and then click Import to import 
macro libraries.
2) Navigate to the directory containing the library to import (Figure 358). Normally you can 
choose between dialog.xlb and script.xlb. It does not matter which of these two 
files you select; both will allow your macro to be imported. Macros can be stored in 
libraries inside LibreOffice documents. To import libraries contained in a document, select  
a document rather than a directory on disk.
Figure 358: Navigating to a macro library
3) Select a file and click Open to continue and open the Import Libraries dialog (Figure  
359).
Chapter 11,  Getting Started with Macros  | 433Figure 359: Choose library import options
4) Select the following options for importing libraries:
– If no options are selected, the library is copied to your user macro directory. However, 
if the library you are importing has the same name and you are importing into the 
same location, it will not be copied.
– Select Insert as reference (read-only)  if you want to use the library as reference, but 
not import that library into the document. When a library is used as a reference, it 
remains in its current location and is fully functional, but cannot be modified in the 
Basic IDE.
– Select Replace existing libraries  if the library you want to import has the same name 
and you want to replace the existing library.
5) Click OK to import the macro library you selected.
Note
You cannot export/import the library named Standard.
Tip
On Linux, LibreOffice-specific files are stored in the user’s home directory inside the  
.config folder. Directories and files with names beginning with a dot may be hidden 
and not shown in a normal file selection dialog. When using LibreOffice dialogs, 
rather than the operating system’s specific dialogs, type the name of the desired 
directory in the Name field.
Downloading macros to import
You can find macros created by the LibreOffice community in the internet. Some macros are 
contained in documents, some as regular files that you need to import, and others are published 
as text and must be copied and pasted into the Basic IDE. See “ Adding a macro” on page 465 
on how to add macros to your macro library and “ Viewing and editing macros ” on page 470 on 
how to edit macros using the Basic IDE.
Some macros are available as free downloads on the Internet (see Table 16).

How to run a macro
You can run a macro with Tools > Macros > Run , but this will not be efficient when you use 
macros frequently. Fortunately LibreOffice has many other ways to run your macros.
While you can assign a shortcut to macros, as seen in “ Running a macro” on page 469, you can 
also link macros to a toolbar icon, menu item, event, or a button embedded in a document. 
When choosing a method, it is also good to ask questions such as:
• Should the macro be available for only one document or globally for all documents?
• Is the macro for a specific document type, such as a Calc document?
• How frequently will the macro be used?
The answers will determine where to store the macro and how to make it available. For example,  
you will probably not add a rarely used macro to a toolbar. To help determine your choices, see 
Table 17.
Table 17. Where to store a macro
Where to place 
the macroFor all LibreOffice 
applicationsFor a specific LO 
applicationFor a single 
document
Toolbar No Yes Yes
Menu No Yes Yes
Shortcut Yes Yes No
Event Yes No Yes
Toolbars, menu items, and keyboard shortcuts
To add a menu item, keyboard shortcut, or toolbar icon that calls a macro, use the Customize 
dialog, which allows you to configure menus, keyboard shortcuts, toolbars, and events. To open 
this dialog, go to Tools > Customize . Use of the Menus, Toolbars, Context Menus, and 
Keyboard tabs are covered in Chapter 13, Customizing LibreOffice.
Events
Whenever LibreOffice detects a user action, we call it an event. For example, opening a 
document, changing status of modified, or moving the mouse cursor are all events. LibreOffice 
allows events to trigger the execution of a macro; the macro is then called an event handler. Full 
coverage of event handlers is well beyond the scope of this chapter, but a little knowledge can 
accomplish much.
Caution
Be careful when you configure an event handler. For example, if you write an event 
handler that is called every time that a document is modified but make a mistake so 
the event is not properly handled, problems can occur. One possible result is that 
your event handler will force you to kill LibreOffice.
Chapter 11,  Getting Started with Macros  | 4351) Go to Tools > Customize  to open the Customize dialog and select the Events tab 
(Figure 360). The events in the Customize dialog are related to the entire application and  
specific documents.
2) In the Save In drop-down, select LibreOffice, or a specific document from the menu to 
save your event.
3) A common use is to assign the Open Document event to call a specific macro. The 
macro then performs certain setup tasks for the document. Select the desired event and 
click Macro to open the Macro Selector dialog (similar to Figure 351 on page 470 but 
with different action buttons).
4) Select the desired macro and click OK to assign the macro to the event. The Events tab 
will show that the event has been assigned to a macro.
Many objects in a document can be set to call macros when events occur. The most common 
use is to add a control, such as a button, into a document. Even double-clicking on a graphic 
opens a dialog with a Macros tab that allows you to assign a macro to an event.
Figure 360: Events tab in Customize dialog
436 |Getting Started 24.8Using extensions
An extension is code that can be installed into LibreOffice to add new functionality. Extensions 
can be written in almost any programming language and may be simple or sophisticated. 
Extensions can be grouped into types, for example:
• Calc add-ins, which provide new functionality for Calc, including new functions that act 
like normal built-in functions.
• New components and functionality, which normally include some level of User Interface 
(UI) integration such as new menus or toolbars.
• Chart add-ins with new chart types.
• Linguistic components such as spelling checkers.
• Document templates and images.
Although individual extensions can be found in several places, there is currently an extension 
repository at: https://extensions.libreoffice.org/  and some documentation at 
https://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:OpenOfficeExtensions/List .
For more about obtaining and installing extensions, see Chapter 13, Customizing LibreOffice.
Writing macros without the recorder
The examples covered so far in this chapter were created using the macro recorder and the 
dispatcher, but you can also write macros in code which directly access the objects that 
comprise LibreOffice. In other words, you can create a macro that directly manipulates a 
document using more advanced programming logic.
Directly manipulating LibreOffice internal objects is an advanced topic that is beyond the scope 
of this chapter. A simple example, however, demonstrates how this works.
An example of a macro in code for Writer
The sample code in Listing 5 is a simple example of a macro created without the recorder that 
adds the string “Hello” at the end of a Writer document.
To add this macro to a library, follow the steps below:
1) Go to Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > Basic .
2) In My Macros, navigate to the library where you want the macro to be created. In this 
example, consider the library TestLibrary.
3) Select one of the modules already available in the library, for example Module1. If you 
want to create a new module, click Organizer and then add the new module.
4) With the module selected, click Edit. This will open the Basic IDE window and show the 
code for the macros implemented in the selected module.
5) Enter the code in Listing 5 into the module.
Listing 5: Append the text “Hello” at the end of to the current document
Sub AppendHello
  Dim oDoc
  Dim sTextService$
  Dim oCurs
  
  REM ThisComponent refers to the currently active document.
  oDoc = ThisComponent
Chapter 11,  Getting Started with Macros  | 437  REM Verify that this is a text document.
  sTextService = "com.sun.star.text.TextDocument"
  If NOT oDoc.supportsService(sTextService) Then
    MsgBox "This macro only works with a text document"
    Exit Sub
  End If
  REM Get the view cursor from the current controller.
  oCurs = oDoc.currentController .getViewCursor()
  
  REM Move the cursor to the end of the document.
  oCurs.gotoEnd(False)
  
  REM Insert text "Hello" at the end of the document.
  oCurs.Text.insertString(oCurs, "Hello", False)  
End Sub
An example of a macro in code for Calc
One powerful way to extend the functionalities of LibreOffice Calc is to write macros that 
automate repetitive tasks. You can use the Basic language to write macros that can do tasks 
ranging from simple cell handling and formatting to advanced data manipulation.
For example, Listing 6 below shows the Basic code for a macro that analyzes a range of cells to 
determine if all values are between 0 and 100. Values ranging from 50 to 100 should be marked 
in light green whereas cells with values that are greater than or equal to 0 and less then 50 
should be marked in light red. If any values outside the allowed range of 0 to 100 are found, a 
warning message should be displayed and cells should be marked in light gray. 
Listing 6: Calc macro to format ranges based on values
Sub FormatRangeBasedOnValue
  'Gets the current selection
  Dim oRange as Object, oCell as Object
  Set oRange = Thiscomponent.getCurrentSelection ()
  'Checks if the selected range is a single range
  If Not oRange.supportsService("com.sun.star.sheet.SheetCellRange" ) Then
    MsgBox "This macro applies only to single ranges."
    Exit Sub
  End If
  ' Number of columns and rows in selection
  Dim nCols as Long : nCols = oRange.Columns.getCount()
  Dim nRows as Long : nRows = oRange.Rows.getCount()
  Dim col as Long, row as Long
  Dim cellValue as Long
  Dim isError as Boolean : isError = False
  ' Iterate over all cells in the range
  For col = 0 To nCols - 1
    For row = 0 to nRows - 1
      Set oCell = oRange.getCellByPosition (col, row)
      cellValue = oCell.getValue()
      If cellValue >= 50 and cellValue <= 100 Then
        ' Sets background to light green
        oCell.CellBackcolor = RGB(144, 238, 144)
      ElseIf cellValue >= 0 and cellValue < 50 Then
        ' Sets background to light red
        oCell.CellBackcolor = RGB(255, 127, 127)
      Else
        ' Sets background to light gray
        oCell.CellBackcolor = RGB(220, 220, 220)
438 |Getting Started 24.8        isError = True
      End If
    Next row
  Next col
  ' Displays a message indicating that there were errors
  If isError Then
    MsgBox "Some cells outside the range 0 to 100 were marked in light grey"

To add this macro to a library, follow the steps described in “ An example of a macro in code for 
Writer” on page 484. To run this macro, first create a new Calc sheet and add some numeric 
values in a range of cells. Then, select the cells and use one of the methods described in “ How 
to run a macro” on page 482 to execute it. 
Figure 361 shows an example of the macro being run on a set of cells. Because some of the 
cells have values that are not between 0 and 100, the message box in Figure 362 will also be 
displayed.

The ScriptForge library
Since macro programmers frequently need to perform tasks such as creating and opening files, 
accessing form controls, reading data from databases embedded in Base documents, and so 
forth, LibreOffice has provided them with the ScriptForge library. This library makes it easier to 
execute such commands without having to learn the required LibreOffice APIs (Application 
Programming Interfaces) and commands, which may be difficult for casual programmers.
ScriptForge is organized into a set of services, each of which provides methods and properties 
related to a specific topic. For example, the Dialog service provides access to dialogs available 
in script modules and the Database service allows to execute SQL commands in Base 
documents. The example in Listing 7 shows a macro written in Basic using the ScriptForge 
library that opens a Calc document, creates a new sheet named NewSheet, and inserts the 
string “Hello” into cell A1. The macro also saves and closes the document.
Chapter 11,  Getting Started with Macros  | 439Listing 7: Macro using the ScriptForge library
Sub CreateSheetExample
  ' Loads the ScriptForge library
  GlobalScope.BasicLibraries.LoadLibrary("ScriptForge")
  ' Instantiates the UI service
  Dim ui as Object, myDoc as Object
  ui = CreateScriptService ("UI")
  ' Opens the file "myfile.ods"
  Set myDoc = ui.OpenDocument("/home/user/Documents/myfile.ods" )
  ' Inserts a new sheet named "NewSheet"
  myDoc.InsertSheet("NewSheet")
  ' Inserts the string "Hello" into cell "A1" of the new sheet
  myDoc.SetValue("NewSheet.A1", "Hello")
  ' Shows the sheet "NewSheet"
  myDoc.Activate("NewSheet")
  ' Saves the document
  myDoc.Save()
  ' Closes the document
  myDoc.CloseDocument()
End Sub
As seen in the example, the ScriptForge library provides straightforward commands to execute 
commands, and simplify the creation of macros.
Tip
To learn more about the ScriptForge library, visit LibreOffice’s online Help at 
https://help.libreoffice.org/7.4/en-US/text/sbasic/shared/03/lib_ScriptForge.html?
DbPAR=BASIC. Each of the 26 supported services have been extensively 
documented and examples are provided for both Basic and Python programming 
languages.
UNO Object Inspector
LibreOffice has an extensive API that can be used by macro programmers to automate almost 
any aspect of its applications. However, programmers often have problems discovering object 
types as well as their supported services, methods, and properties.
The component model used in LibreOffice is known as Universal Network Objects or UNO. 
LibreOffice macros in any scripting language use a UNO runtime application programming 
interface (API). The XSCRIPTCONTEXT interface is provided to macro scripts in all four 
available languages (LibreOffice Basic, Python, JavaScript, and BeanShell) which provides 
some means of access to the various interfaces which they might need to perform an action on a  
document.
The UNO Object Inspector  can help macro developers inspect objects, learn how to access 
them, and use them in macros. This feature is available in Writer, Calc, Impress, and Draw. To 
enable it, go to Tools > Development Tools . The Object Inspector will be opened at the bottom 
of the user interface, as shown in Figure 363.
The left portion of the Object Inspector consists of the Document Object Model (DOM)  navigator, 
which allows the user to navigate through all the objects in the document. When an object is 
selected, information about the object are shown in the right portion of the Object Inspector 
window:
• The names of all implemented interfaces.
• The names of all services supported by the object.
440 |Getting Started 24.8• The names and types of all properties available in the object.
• The names, arguments and return types of all methods that can be called by the object.
Figure 363: UNO Object Inspector opened in a Writer document
Instead of inspecting objects using the DOM navigator, it is possible to directly inspect the 
currently selected object in the document by toggling the Current Selection  button.
For example, suppose you want to change the background color of the text selected in a Writer 
document. You can select a portion of text, open the Object Inspector, toggle the Current 
Selection button, then inspect the object properties in search of a property that matches the 
desired effect. Figure 364 shows the CharBackColor property selected, which is the property 
used to set text background color.
Figure 364: Using the Object Inspector to find a property
Chapter 11,  Getting Started with Macros  | 441Now it is possible to write a macro using this property to change the background color of the 
selected text. Listing 8 shows the code for this macro.
Listing 8: Macro that changes the background color of a text range
Sub ChangeTextBGColor
  Dim oSel as Object
  Set oSel = ThisComponent.getCurrentSelection ()
  oSel(0).CharBackColor = RGB(255, 127, 127)
End Sub
Note that in Writer it is possible to have multiple ranges selected at once, hence oSel(0) 
accesses the first range of text.
Overview of Python, BeanShell, and JavaScript macros
Many programmers may not be familiar with LibreOffice Basic, so LibreOffice supports macros 
written in three other familiar languages: Python, BeanShell, and JavaScript.
Macros are organized in the same way for all four scripting languages. The LibreOffice Macros  
container holds all the macros that are supplied in the LibreOffice installation. The My Macros 
library container holds those macros that you made available to any of your LibreOffice 
documents. Each document can also contain your macros that are not available to any other 
document.
When you use the recording facility, the macros are created in LibreOffice Basic. To use the 
other available scripting languages, you must write the code yourself.
When you select to run a macro using Tools > Macros > Run Macro , LibreOffice displays the 
Macro Selector dialog. This dialog enables selection and running of any available macro, coded 
in any of the available languages (Figure 365).
When you edit a macro using Tools > Macros > Edit Macros , LibreOffice displays the 
LibreOffice Basic IDE. This dialog enables selection and editing of any available LibreOffice 
Basic macro, but not macros in other languages.
Figure 365: Macro Selector dialog

If you want to learn more about the LibreOffice API as well as UNO objects, refer to 
the official API documentation at https://api.libreoffice.org/
Python macros
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was first released in 1991.
When you select Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > Python , LibreOffice displays the 
Python Macros dialog (Figure 366). Facilities to edit and debug Python scripts are not currently 
integrated into the standard LibreOffice user interface. However, you can use any Python editor 
to create scripts and then copy these files into the Scripts folder in your home directory. For more  
information, refer to “ Where are macros stored? ” on page 479.
Figure 366: Python Macros dialog
Listing 9 presents an example of a Python macro that writes the text “Hello World from Python” 
into cell A1 of the first sheet in a Calc spreadsheet.
Listing 9: Sample Python macro
import uno  
def HelloWorld():
    doc = XSCRIPTCONTEXT.getDocument()
    cell = doc.Sheets[0]['A1']
    cell.setString('Hello World from Python' )
    return
Tip
The Alternative Python Script Organizer (APSO) extension makes it easier to edit 
and organize Python scripts, especially when they are embedded in a document. 
Using APSO you can configure your preferred source code editor, start the 
integrated Python shell and debug Python scripts. Visit 
https://gitlab.com/jmzambon/apso  to download APSO and learn more about how to 
use it.
Chapter 11,  Getting Started with Macros  | 443Tip
To learn more about Python scripting in LibreOffice, you can refer to the Wiki 
“Macros/Python Basics”, where you will find in-depth explanations and examples on 
how to get started with Python scripting. To learn more, visit 
https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Macros/Python_Basics .
BeanShell macros
BeanShell is a Java-like scripting language that was first released in 1999.
When you select Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > BeanShell , LibreOffice displays the 
BeanShell Macros dialog (Figure 367).
Figure 367: BeanShell Macros dialog
Click the Edit button on the BeanShell Macros dialog to access the BeanShell Debug Window 
(Figure 368).

cellText = UnoRuntime.queryInterface(XText.class, cell);
textCursor = cellText.createTextCursor();
cellText.insertString(textCursor, "Hello World from BeanShell" , true);
return 0;
JavaScript macros
JavaScript is a high-level scripting language that was first released in 1995.
When you select Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > JavaScript , LibreOffice displays the 
JavaScript Macros dialog (Figure 369).
Figure 369: JavaScript Macros dialog
Listing 11 is an example of a JavaScript macro that inserts the text “Hello World from JavaScript”  
in cell A1 of the first sheet in a Calc spreadsheet.

Changing the color scheme of the Basic IDE
To change the color scheme used by the Basic IDE code editor, do the following steps:
1) From within the Basic IDE go to View > Color scheme  to open the Color Scheme 
dialog
2) By default the option Use Application Colors  is selected, which makes the Basic IDE 
use the colors defined in the Application Colors  dialog (accessible via Tools > Options 
> Application Colors )
3) To use a different color scheme, click Choose Color Scheme  and select one of the 
available entries in the list box
4) Click OK to apply the selected color scheme
Figure 370 shows the code editor after selecting the Solarized Light color scheme. Notice that 
the color scheme only changes the colors used by the code editor.

on that page to the values that were in place when the dialog opened.
User data
On the User Data page of the Options LibreOffice dialog (Figure  371), the details of a LibreOffice  
user can be entered and stored. These user details are used for several things within LibreOffice  
such as who created or last edited a document , author of comments or changes, sender 
address in mailing lists, and so on.
It is necessary to make sure that the correct user information appears here. Fill in the necessary 
information if these details are blank, or amend and/or delete any existing information not 
required.
If user data is not going to be used for document’s properties, deselect the option Apply user 
data in the Properties dialog for the LibreOffice file that is open. Go to File > Properties on the 
Menu bar to open the Properties dialog for a file.
In Cryptography on the User Data page, set the preferred public keys for OpenPGP encryption 
and digital signature. These keys are pre-selected in the text boxes for OpenPGP signing key  
and OpenPGP encryption key  when a document is digitally signed or encrypted (for more

over Postscript. For more information, see the following link: 
https://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/
pdf_as_standard_print_job_format .
Convert colors to grayscale
Specifies that all colors in a document are printed only as grayscale.
Include transparent objects
If selected, the reduction in print quality for bitmaps also applies to the transparent 
areas of objects.
Reduce bitmaps
Specifies that bitmaps are printed with reduced quality. The resolution can only be 
reduced and not increased.
Chapter 12,  Configuring LibreOffice  | 455Resolution
Specifies the maximum print quality in DPI. The resolution can only be reduced and 
not increased.
High print quality
High print quality corresponds to a resolution of 300dpi.
Normal print quality
Normal print quality corresponds to a resolution of 200dpi.
Note
Reducing the amount of data sent to the printer increases the print speed because 
the print files are smaller. This makes it easier for printers with a smaller memory 
when printing large files. However, reducing print data can result in slightly lower 
print quality.
Reduce transparency
If selected, transparent objects are printed like normal, non-transparent objects, 
depending on your selection in the following two option buttons.
Automatically
Specifies that the transparency is only printed if the transparent area covers less than 
a quarter of the entire page.
No transparency
When selected, a transparency does not print.
Note
Transparencies cannot be sent directly to a printer. Transparencies must be visible to  
be calculated as bitmaps and sent to the printer. Depending on bitmap size and the 
print resolution, a large amount of data may result.
Warnings
Defines which warnings appear before printing begins.
Paper size
Select this option if a certain paper size is required for printing the current document. If  
the paper size used in the document is not provided by the current printer, an error 
message opens.
Paper orientation
Select this option if a certain paper orientation is required for printing the current 
document. If the format used by the current document is not available from the printer, 
an error message opens.
Transparency
Select this option if a warning is required if transparent objects are contained in the 
document. When printing a document with transparencies, a dialog opens to enable 
selection if the transparency is to be printed.
Reduce gradient
If selected, gradients are printed with reduced quality.
Gradient stripes
Specifies the maximum number of gradient stripes for printing.
Intermediate color
Specifies that gradients are only printed in a single intermediate color.
456 |Getting Started 24.8Paths
On the Paths page in the Options LibreOffice dialog (Figure  375), the location of files associated

Certificate Path
Linux and macOS only — users can digitally sign documents using LibreOffice. A digital 
signature requires a personal signing certificate and most operating systems can 
generate a self-signed certificate. However, a personal certificate issued by an outside 
agency (after verifying an individual identity) has a higher degree of trust associated with 
it than does a self-signed certificate. LibreOffice does not provide a secure method of 
storing these certificates, but it can access certificates that have been saved using other 
programs. Click Certificate and select which certificate store to use. For Windows, 
LibreOffice uses the default Windows location for storing and retrieving certificates.
TSAs
Optionally select a Time Stamping Authority (TSA) URL for PDF documents created by

Application colors
On the Application Colors page of the Options LibreOffice dialog (Figure  379), the overall 
appearance of LibreOffice can be changed by setting the colors used for the LibreOffice user 
interface. Current settings of a color scheme being used can be saved and reloaded at a later 
time.
Changing colors can make using LibreOffice easier, for example when writing, editing, creating 
page layouts and page margins, inserting page breaks or graphics, and so on. Also, users may 
prefer different colors from those used as LibreOffice defaults.

Advanced
On the Advanced page of the Options LibreOffice dialog (Figure  Error: no se encontró el origen 
de la referencia), the support options are specified for Java applications in LibreOffice, including 
which Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to use. It also specifies whether to use experimental 
(unstable) features such as macro recording.
Notes
Windows users have a suitable Java Runtime Environment (JRE) already installed 
on their machines. Linux users may need to get a JRE from the distribution software 
repository if it not already installed. MacOS users need to install Oracle Java 
Development Kit (JDK), not just JRE. To get the required JDK, select the macOS 
option at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/ .
Some options cannot be reset once edited. Either undo the changes manually, or 
click Cancel and reopen the Options LibreOffice dialog.
Make sure to install a JRE that is compatible with the LibreOffice architecture being 
used. That is 64-bit JRE for 64-bit LibreOffice and 32-bit JRE for 32-bit LibreOffice.
Java Options
If a JRE or JDK is installed after installing LibreOffice, or if more than one JRE is 
installed on a computer, use Java Options to select the JRE for LibreOffice to use.
If LibreOffice finds one or more JREs on a computer, it displays them in the list box. 
Select one of the JREs listed.
A system administrator, programmer, or other person who customizes JRE installations, 
can use the Parameters and Class Path dialogs to specify this information.
Use a Java runtime environment
This allows the running of Java applications in LibreOffice. When a Java application 
attempts to access a hard drive, a prompt opens.
Java runtime environments (JRE) already installed
Select the JRE required. On some systems, it may take at least a minute until the list 
is populated. On some systems, LibreOffice has to be restarted to use any changed 
settings. The path to the JRE is displayed beneath the list box.
The default JRE of the operating system can be overridden with one of the following 
alternatives:
By setting the environment variable JAVA_HOME.
By adding a JRE to the $PATH variable.
By providing the configuration file for the computer operating system in the folder 
<instdir>/presets/config .
Add
Add a path to the root folder of a JRE on a computer. The path is set in the Select Path  
dialog.
Parameters
Opens the Java Start Parameters dialog.
464 |Getting Started 24.8Class Path
Opens the Class Path dialog.
Optional Features
Enable experimental features (may be unstable)
Select this option to enable features that are not yet complete, or contain known bugs. 
The list of these features is different version by version.
Enable macro recording (may be limited)
This option enables macro recording, with some limitations. Opening a window, 
switching between windows, and recording in a different window from where the 
recording began, are not supported. Only actions relating to document contents are 
recordable, so changes in options or customizing menus are not supported. For more 
about macro recording, see Chapter 11, Getting Started with Macros.
Open Expert Configuration
Most users will have no need to use this. Select this option to open a new dialog in 
which the LibreOffice installation can be fine tuned. The dialog offers detailed 
configuration options for many aspects of the LibreOffice appearance and 
performance. Double-click on a listed preference to enter a value to configure the 
preference.
Note
The Expert Configuration dialog lets a user access, edit, and save configuration 
preferences that can make the user profile of LibreOffice unstable, inconsistent, or 
even unusable. If there is no knowledge what an option does, it is best to leave the 
option at its default setting.
Online Update
Figure 381: Options LibreOffice dialog — Online Update page
Chapter 12,  Configuring LibreOffice  | 465On the Online Update page of the Options LibreOffice dialog (Figure  381), options are specified 
for the automatic notification and downloading of online updates to LibreOffice.

(Open Computing Language) greatly improves speed and responsiveness for a wide spectrum 
of applications in numerous market categories from gaming and entertainment to scientific and 
medical software. For more information on OpenCL, visit https://www.khronos.org/opencl/ .
With OpenCL enabled, LibreOffice can benefit from the very fast numerical calculations 
performed in the GPU, which is especially useful in very large spreadsheets with extensive 
calculations. The computer video card driver must have support for OpenCL to use this feature.
Loading and saving documents
Options for loading and saving documents can be selected in the Options Load/Save dialog to 
suit working requirements on a computer system. If the Options Load/Save dialog is not already 
open, go to Tools > Options > Load/Save  (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > Load/Save ) 
on the Menu bar.
General
On the General page of the Options Load/Save dialog (Figure  382), the default settings for 
saving documents and default file formats can be selected.
Load
Load user-specific settings with the document
A LibreOffice document contains settings that are read from a computer system. When  
saving a document, these settings are saved with it. Select this option so that when a 
document loads, it ignores the stored settings in favor of the settings on the computer. 
If this option is not selected, the following user-specific settings still apply:
Settings in File > Print > Options .
Spacing options for paragraphs before text tables.
466 |Getting Started 24.8Information about automatic updating for links, field functions, and charts.
Information about working with Asian character formats.
The data source linked to the document and its view are always loaded with the 
document, whether or not this option is selected.
Load printer settings with the document
If enabled, the printer settings are loaded with the document. This can cause a 
document to be printed on a distant printer (perhaps in an office setting). To prevent 
this happening, manually change the printer in the Print dialog. If disabled, the default 
printer will be used to print the document. The current printer settings are stored with 
the document whether or not this option is selected.
Save
Save AutoRecovery information every __ minutes
Select AutoRecovery and the time period for how often the information used by the 
AutoRecovery process is saved. AutoRecovery saves information required to restore 
all open documents if LibreOffice crashes. Setting this option makes recovering a 
document after a system crash easier.
In adition to the AutoRecovery information option, LibreOffice can also automatically 
save the document in the given time interval.
Edit document properties before saving
Specifies that the Properties dialog opens when a file is saved for the first time and 
every time Save As is selected.
Always create backup copy
Saves the previous version of a document as a backup copy whenever a document is 
saved. Every time LibreOffice creates a backup copy, the previous backup copy is 
replaced. A backup copy uses the extension BAK.
To change the location of the backup copy, go to Tools > Options > LibreOffice > 
Paths (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > LibreOffice > Paths ) and then enter a 
new path for the backup file.
Figure 382: Options Load/Save dialog — General page
Chapter 12,  Configuring LibreOffice  | 467Save URLs relative to file system/Save URLs relative to the Internet
Selecting these options specifies the default for relative addressing of URLs in the file 
system and on the Internet. Relative addressing is only possible if the source 
document and the referenced document are both on the same drive.
A relative address always starts from the directory in which the current document is 
located. In contrast, absolute addressing always starts from a root directory. The 
following table demonstrates the difference in syntax between relative and absolute 
referencing:
Table 20: Examples of saving URLs
ExamplesFile system Internet
relative../images/img.jpg ../images/img.jpg
absolutefile:///c:/work/images/img.jp http://myserver.com/work/images/img.jpg
Default File Format and ODF Settings
ODF format version
LibreOffice support the OpenDocument format (ODF) version 1.3 Extended. This 
format allows for improved functionality, but there may be backwards compatibility 
issues. The previous versions of LibreOffice support the file format ODF 1.2. However, 
previous file formats cannot store all new features of the newer version of LibreOffice. 
This version of LibreOffice can open and save documents in previous versions of ODF 
formats.
Document type
Specifies the document type to define the default file format.
Always save as
Specifies that documents of the type selected on the left are always saved as the file 
type selected from the drop-down list. Another file type for the current document can 
be selected in the Save as dialog.
Warn when not saving in ODF or default format
When selected, a warning message is displayed when saving a document in a format 
that is not the selected default format, or ODF format.
VBA properties
Figure 383: Options Load/Save dialog — VBA Properties page
468 |Getting Started 24.8On the VBA Properties page of the Options Load/Save dialog (Figure  383), the general 
properties for loading and saving Microsoft Office documents with VBA (Visual Basic for 
Applications) code are specified.
Microsoft Word
Select the settings for Microsoft Word documents.
Load Basic code
Loads and saves Basic code from a Microsoft document as a special LibreOffice Basic  
module with the document. When saving the document in OpenDocument format, the 
Basic code is saved as well. When saving in another format, the Basic code from the 
LibreOffice Basic IDE is not saved.
Executable code
If selected, the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code is loaded ready to be 
executed. If not selected, the VBA code is commented out so it can be inspected, but 
not run.
Note
After loading the VBA code, LibreOffice inserts the statement Option VBASupport 1 
in every Basic module to enable a limited support for VBA statements, functions and 
objects.
Save original Basic code
Specifies that the original Microsoft Basic code contained in the document is held in a 
special internal memory for as long as the document remains loaded in LibreOffice. 
When saving the document in Microsoft format, the Microsoft Basic code is saved 
again with the code in an unchanged form.
When saving in a format other than Microsoft Format, the Microsoft Basic Code is not 
saved. For example, if the document contains Microsoft Basic code and the document 
is saved in OpenDocument format, a warning is displayed stating that Microsoft Basic 
code will not be saved.
The Save original Basic code  selection takes precedence over the Load Basic code 
selection. If both options are marked and the disabled Basic code is edited in the 
LibreOffice Basic IDE, the original Microsoft Basic code is saved when saving in 
Microsoft format.
To remove any possible Microsoft Basic macro viruses from a Microsoft document, 
deselect Save original Basic code  and save the document in Microsoft format. The 
document is saved without the Microsoft Basic code.
Microsoft Excel
For information on Load Basic code, Executable code, and Save original Basic code , see 
Microsoft Word above.
Microsoft PowerPoint
For information on Load Basic code and Save original Basic code , see Microsoft Word 
above.
Microsoft Office
On the Microsoft Office page of the Options Load/Save dialog (Figure  384), the settings for 
importing and exporting Microsoft Office and other documents are specified.
Embedded Objects
Embedded Objects  specifies how Microsoft Office objects, or other OLE objects, are 
imported and exported. These settings are valid even when no Microsoft, or other OLE, 
Chapter 12,  Configuring LibreOffice  | 469server exists (for example, in UNIX), or when there is no LibreOffice OLE server ready 
for editing the OLE objects.
If an OLE server is active for the embedded object, then the OLE server is used to 
handle the object.
If no OLE server is active for MathType objects, then embedded MathType objects are 
converted to LibreOffice Math objects. For this conversion, the embedded MathType 
objects must not exceed the MathType 3.1 specifications.
Figure 384: Options Load/Save dialog — Microsoft Office page
[L] and [S] Columns
Selecting the [L] and [S] columns displays the entries for OLE objects that can be 
converted when loading into LibreOffice [L] and/or when saving into a Microsoft format 
[S].
Select the [L] column in front of the entry if a Microsoft or other OLE object, is to be 
converted into the specified LibreOffice OLE object when a Microsoft or other document 
is loaded into LibreOffice.
Select the [S] column in front of the entry if a LibreOffice OLE object is to be converted 
into the specified Microsoft OLE object when a document is saved in a Microsoft file 
format.
Character Highlighting
Microsoft Office has two character attributes similar to LibreOffice character highlighting. 
Use this control to select the attribute, highlighting or shading, that LibreOffice should 
use when exporting LibreOffice character highlighting to Microsoft Office file formats.
Highlighting
Exports the closest match between a LibreOffice highlighting color and one of the 16 
Microsoft highlighting colors. This character attribute makes it easy for Microsoft Office  
users to edit with the highlighting tool in Microsoft Office applications.
470 |Getting Started 24.8Shading
Exports all RGB colors to the other Microsoft Office character attribute. This preserves 
color fidelity between LibreOffice and Microsoft Office documents, but Microsoft Office 
users must edit this character attribute with a tool that is not commonly used or easy to  
find in Microsoft Office applications. This is the default setting since LibreOffice 7.0.
Tip
The compatibility filter in the Character Highlighting Color dialog provides the 
Microsoft Office highlighting colors. Use those colors and choose Highlighting if both 
color fidelity and ease of editing is required for Microsoft Office users.
Lock files
Select Lock files to generate a Microsoft Office lock file in addition to the LibreOffice lock  
file. Lock files signal to applications that a resource or file should not be used until the 
lock is released. LibreOffice can read lock files generated by Microsoft Office.
HTML compatibility
On the HTML compatibility page of the Options Load/Save dialog (Figure  385), define the 
settings for HTML pages.
Font sizes
Use Size 1 to Size 7 to define the respective font sizes for the HTML <font size=1> to 
<font size=7> tags.
Import
Defines the settings for importing HTML documents.
Figure 385: Options Load/Save dialog — HTML Compatibility page
Use 'English (USA)' locale for numbers
When importing numbers from an HTML page, the decimal separator and the 
thousands separator characters differ according to the locale of the HTML page. The 
clipboard, however, contains no information about the locale. For example, the 
characters "1.000" copied from a German Web page probably mean “one thousand” 
because the dot-on-the-line is the thousands separator in a German locale. If copied 
from an English Web page, the same characters stand for the number 1 as in “one dot 
zero zero zero”.
Chapter 12,  Configuring LibreOffice  | 471If not selected, numbers are interpreted according to the setting in Tools > Options > 
Languages and Locales  (macOS LibreOffice > Preferences > Languages and 
Locales). If marked, numbers are interpreted using the English (USA) locale.
Import unknown HTML tags as fields
Select this option if tags that are not recognized by LibreOffice are to be imported as 
fields. For an opening tag, an HTML_ON field is created with the value of the tag name. 
For a closing tag, an HTML_OFF is created. These fields are converted to tags in the 
HTML export.
Ignore font settings
Select this option to ignore all font settings when importing. The fonts that were 
defined in the HTML Page Style are the fonts used.
Export
LibreOffice Basic
Select this option to include the LibreOffice Basic instructions when exporting to HTML  
format.
This option must be selected before creating the LibreOffice Basic Script, otherwise it 
will not be inserted. LibreOffice Basic scripts must be located in the header of the 
HTML document. Once the macro is created in LibreOffice Basic IDE, it appears in the  
source text of the HTML document in the header.
Display warning
If selected, when exporting to HTML a warning is displayed stating that LibreOffice 
Basic macros will be lost.
Print layout
If selected, the print layout of the current document (for example, table of contents with  
justified page numbers and dot leaders) is exported as well. It can be read by 
LibreOffice, Mozilla Firefox, and MS Internet Explorer.
Note
The HTML filter supports CSS2 (Cascading Style Sheets Level 2) for printing 
documents. Note that these capabilities are only effective if print layout export is 
activated.
Copy local images to Internet
Select this option to automatically upload the embedded images to the Internet server 
when uploading using FTP. Use the Save As dialog to save the document and enter a 
complete FTP URL as the file name in the Internet.
Note
Some options cannot be reset once edited. Either undo the changes manually, or 
click Cancel and reopen the Options dialog.

When Default is selected, the following two text boxes are filled with the default 
characters for the selected language:
Not at start of line
Specifies the characters that will not appear alone at the beginning of a line. If a 
character typed here is positioned at the beginning of a line after a line break, it is 
automatically moved to the end of the previous line. For example, an exclamation point  
at the end of a sentence never appears at the start of a line if it is listed in the Not at 
start of line list.
Not at end of line
Specifies the characters that will not appear alone at the end of a line. If a character 
typed here is positioned at the end of a line due to a line break, it is automatically 
moved to the beginning of the next line. For example, a currency symbol that appears 
in front of an amount never appears at the end of a line if it is listed in the Not at end of 
line list.
Complex Text Layout
Defines the options for documents that use Complex Text Layouts (CTL). To enable these 
options, go to Tools > Options > Language and Locale > General  (macOS LibreOffice > 
Preferences > Language and Locale > General ) on the Menu bar. On the Complex Text 
Layout page of the Options Languages and Locales dialog (Figure  390), the options for Complex  
Text Layout can be specified.
Currently, LibreOffice supports Hindi, Thai, Hebrew, and Arabic as CTL languages.
If the text flow from right to left is selected, embedded Western text still runs from left to right. 
The cursor responds to the arrow keys. The right arrow key moves the cursor toward the text 
end and the left arrow key moves the cursor toward the text start.
Chapter 12,  Configuring LibreOffice  | 479Change the text writing direction directly be using one of the following keyboard combinations. 
These keyboard combinations only work when CTL support is enabled.
• Switch to right-to-left text entry — Ctrl+Shift+D or Ctrl+Right Shift Key  (macOS 
⌘+Shift+D or ⌘+Right Shift Key ).
• Switch to left-to-right text entry — Ctrl+Shift+A or Ctrl+Left Shift Key  (macOS 
⌘+Shift+A or ⌘+Left Shift Key ).
Figure 390: Options Languages and Locales dialog — Complex Text Layout page
In multicolumn pages, sections, or frames that are formatted with text flow from right to left, the 
first column is the right column and the last column is the left column.
Sequence Checking
In languages, for example Thai, rules specify that certain characters are not allowed next  
to other characters. If Sequence Input Checking (SIC) is enabled, LibreOffice will not 
allow a character next to another specific character if it is forbidden by a rule.
Use sequence checking
Enables sequence input checking for languages.
Restricted
Prevents the use and the printing of illegal character combinations.
Type and replace
When selected, allows typing and replacing of characters.
Cursor control
Select the type of cursor movement and text selection for mixed text (right-to-left mixed 
with left-to-right text direction).

Adding fonts
LibreOffice supports the PostScript ( .pfb), TrueType (.ttf), and OpenType (.otf) font file 
formats. Other font formats are available and may be supported by the operating system. 
However, these font formats may be limited in character selection and quality.
Administration privileges are required to install additional fonts. After installation onto an 
operating system, any additional fonts are available for use by all modules in LibreOffice.
In addition to proprietary fonts from sources like Adobe, hundreds of free license fonts are 
available. Most free license fonts are available at no cost and can be used, shared, and edited. 
Many of these fonts are clones, or close variations of classic fonts, but several fonts are original.
Many Linux distributions include some free license fonts in their package repositories. There are 
several places where free licenses are available, such as The League of Movable Type 
(https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com ), or the Open Font Library ( https://fontlibrary.org ).
User interface variants
By default, commands and functions in LibreOffice are grouped in cascading menus with tools 
available on toolbars, called the Standard Toolbar user interface. Other user interface variants, 
are available, displaying contextual groups of commands and contents. With each LibreOffice 
module having different requirements, refer to the specific user guide for each LibreOffice 
module for a full description of user interface variants and how to use the user interface.
Figure 407: Select Your Preferred User Interface dialog
Chapter 13,  Customizing LibreOffice  | 501Select a preferred user interface variant as follows:
1) Open a LibreOffice module to change the user interface.
2) Go to View > User Interface  on the Menu bar to open the Select Your Preferred User 
Interface dialog (Figure  407).
3) Select the preferred user interface from the options available in UI variants. A preview of 
the selected user interface is displayed in the dialog.
4) To use the selected user interface for all LibreOffice modules, click on Apply to All.
5) To only use the selected user interface for the LibreOffice module that is open, click on 
Apply to {Module} , for example Apply to Writer.
6) Click on Close to close the dialog.

Appendix A, 
Keyboard ShortcutsIntroduction
LibreOffice can be used without requiring a pointing device, such as a mouse or trackball, by 
using the keyboard shortcuts that are available in Draw. Tasks as varied and complex as docking  
and un-docking toolbars and windows, or changing the size or position of objects can all be 
accomplished with using keyboard shortcuts. Although LibreOffice has an extensive set of 
keyboard shortcuts, each LibreOffice module has keyboard shortcuts that are specific to that 
module.
This appendix lists some of the more common keyboard shortcuts that apply to multiple 
components of LibreOffice. For shortcuts specific to Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, or Base, 
refer to the relevant user guide for each module, or search the LibreOffice Help.
To assist a user with identifying keyboard shortcuts, these are indicated by text next to menu 
items and in tooltips for some tools on toolbars. For example, in Writer some commonly used 
keyboard shortcuts are as follows:
• File > Open on the Menu bar includes text indicating that Ctrl+O (macOS ⌘+O) is a 
keyboard shortcut.
• Align Left tool in the Formatting toolbar has a tooltip indicating that Ctrl+L 
(macOS ⌘+L) is a keyboard shortcut.
A list of available keyboard shortcuts in LibreOffice can be found in the keyboard tab of the 
Customize dialog box. Go to Tools > Customize  on the Menu bar and click on Keyboard 
section to open the Keyboard tab. Examples of keyboard shortcuts for Linux/Windows see 
Figure 408 and for macOS see Figure  409.
Figure 408: Customize dialog — Keyboard tab for Linux/Windows
504 |Getting Started 24.8Figure 409: Customize dialog — Keyboard tab for macOS
Note
Some keyboard shortcuts listed may not be available, if the computer operating 
system uses the same shortcuts as LibreOffice for other tasks. To solve any conflicts,  
assign different keys to these shortcuts by reconfiguring either LibreOffice (see 
Chapter 13, Customizing LibreOffice), or the computer operating system (see 
operating system documentation or help).
LibreOffice assistive tools
In addition to keyboard shortcuts, LibreOffice supports some assistive technology tools like 
screen magnification software, screen readers, and on-screen keyboards. Please note that 
except for the Windows platform, accessibility support relies on Java technology for 
communication with assistive technology tools. This means that the first program startup may 
take a few seconds longer, because the Java runtime environment has to be started as well.
The current list of supported assistive tools can be found at 
https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Accessibility .
macOS keyboard shortcuts
Some keystrokes and menu items are different on a macOS computer from those used in 
Windows or Linux computers. This due to the way the different  systems work and the different 
types of keyboards used. Also, the labeling on keyboards may vary depending on the age of the 
computer and style of keyboard being used.
Appendix A,  Keyboard Shortcuts  | 505Tables 21, 22 and 23 show the most common variations in keyboard shortcuts and keyboard 
labeling. Table 24 shows examples of using macOS keyboard shortcuts. For more information on  
keyboard shortcuts, see LibreOffice Help.

Note
In computers using macOS, some keyboard shortcuts are not available and these 
unavailable keyboard shortcuts are indicated in the following tables with a blank cell.
Some of the shortcut keys may be assigned to the computer operating system and 
are not available for LibreOffice. Either assign different keys in LibreOffice using 
Tools > Customize > Keyboard  on the Menu bar, or in the computer operating 
506 |Getting Started 24.8system. For more information, see Chapter 13, Customizing LibreOffice or the 
documentation/help for the computer operating system.

Appendix B, 
Open Source, Open 
Standards, OpenDocumentIntroduction
LibreOffice is a productivity suite that is compatible with other major office suites and available 
on a variety of platforms. It is open source software and therefore free to download, use, and 
distribute. If you are new to LibreOffice, this appendix will provide some information regarding its 
history, its community, and some of its technical specifications.
A short history of LibreOffice
The OpenOffice.org project began when Sun Microsystems released the source code 
(“blueprints”) for its StarOffice® software to the open source community on 13 October 2000. 
OpenOffice.org 1.0, the product, was released on 30 April 2002. Major updates to 
OpenOffice.org included version 2.0 in October 2005 and version 3.0 in October 2008. On 26 
January 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems.
On 28 September 2010, the community of volunteers who develop and promote OpenOffice.org 
announced a major change in project structure. After ten years of successful growth with Sun 
Microsystems as founding and principle sponsor, the project launched an independent 
foundation called The Document Foundation, to fulfill the promise of independence written in the 
original charter. This foundation is the cornerstone of a new ecosystem where individuals and 
organizations can contribute to and benefit from the availability of a truly free office suite.
Unable to acquire the trademarked OpenOffice.org name from Oracle Corporation, The 
Document Foundation named its product as LibreOffice. Continuing the version numbers from 
OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice 3.3 was released in January 2011 and version  was released in 
August 2024.
In February 2012, The Document Foundation was incorporated in Berlin as a German Stiftung. 
You can read more about The Document Foundation at: www.documentfoundation.org .
Figure 410: Timeline of major LibreOffice releases
For more detailed history of LibreOffice, visit https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/libreoffice-
timeline/ 
The LibreOffice community
The Document Foundation’s mission is:
“...to facilitate the evolution of the OpenOffice.org Community into a new open, 
independent, and meritocratic organizational structure within the next few months. An 
independent Foundation is a better match to the values of our contributors, users, and 
supporters, and will enable a more effective, efficient, transparent, and inclusive 
Community. We will protect past investments by building on the solid achievements of 
our first decade, encourage wide participation in the Community, and co-ordinate activity 
across the Community.”
516 |Getting Started 24.8LibreOffice is key in the drive to provide an office suite that is available to anyone, anywhere, for 
commercial or personal use, with its open source software license, that has been translated into 
several languages and runs on all major operating systems. New functionality can be added in 
the form of extensions.
How to participate in LibreOffice Community?
The LibreOffice community invites contributors in all areas, including translators, software 
developers, graphic artists, technical writers, editors, donors, and end-user support. Whatever 
you do best, you can make a difference in LibreOffice. The community operates internationally in  
all time zones and in many languages, linked through the internet at www.libreoffice.org  and 
www.documentfoundation.org .
To guide new users in all  possible activities in the LibreOffice project, please visit 
https://whatcanidoforlibreoffice.org  .
How is LibreOffice licensed?
LibreOffice is distributed under both the Mozilla Public License (MPL) 2.0 
(www.libreoffice.org/about-us/licenses/ ) and the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) 
3.0+ (www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html ).
What is open source?
The four essential rights of open-source software are embodied within the Free Software 
Foundation family of the GNU General Public License (GPL):
• The right to use the software for any purpose.
• Freedom to redistribute the software for free or for a fee.
• Access to the complete source code of the program (that is, the “blueprints”).
• The right to modify any part of the source, or use portions of it in other programs.
The basic idea behind open source is very simple: when programmers can read, redistribute, 
and modify the source code for a piece of software, the software evolves. People improve it, 
people adapt it, people fix bugs.
For more information on Free and Open Source software, visit these websites:
• Open Source Initiative (OSI): www.opensource.org .
• Free Software Foundation (FSF): www.fsf.org.
What are open standards?
An open standard defines a method for accomplishing something that is independent of 
manufacturer or vendor. In this case, we are discussing open standards which allows competing 
software programs to freely use the same file formats. HTML, XML, and ODF are examples of 
open standards documents.
In computing, an open standard meets the following requirements:
• It is well documented with the complete specification publicly available, either free or at a  
nominal charge.
• It can be freely copied, distributed, and used. The intellectual property of the standard is 
made irrevocably available on a royalty-free basis.
Appendix B,  Open Source, Open Standards, OpenDocument  | 517• It is standardized and maintained in an independent, open forum (also called “standards 
organization”) using an open process.
What is OpenDocument?
OpenDocument (ODF) is an XML-based file format for office documents (text documents, 
spreadsheets, drawings, presentations, and more), developed at OASIS ( https://www.oasis-
open.org/), an independent, international standards group. OpenDocument version 1.2 was 
adopted by the International Standards Organization and named ISO/IEC 26300:2015 standard. 
In December 2019, ODF 1.3 was approved as a committee specification.
The OASIS OpenDocument version 1.3 specifications are available in the following links:
• Part 1, Introduction: 
https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/OpenDocument-v1.3-part1-
introduction.html 
• Part 2, Packages: 
https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/OpenDocument-v1.3-part2-
packages.html 
• Part 3, OpenDocument Schema: 
https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/OpenDocument-v1.3-part3-
schema.html 
• Part 4, Recalculated Formula (OpenFormula) Format: 
https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/OpenDocument-v1.3-part4-
formula.html 
Unlike other file formats, ODF (ISO/IEC 26300:2015) is an open standard. It is publicly available,  
royalty-free, and without legal or other restrictions; therefore ODF files are not tied to a specific 
office suite and anyone can build a program that interprets these files. For this reason ODF is 
important for government agencies, schools and other companies who prefer not to be too 
dependent on any software supplier.
LibreOffice  saves documents in ODF 1.3 Extended by default. LibreOffice can also open and 
save in earlier versions of the ODF standard, as well as many other file formats, as summarized 
in this Help page:
https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/shared/guide/convertfilters.html  
OpenDocument filename extensions
The most common filename extensions used for OpenDocument documents are summarized in
